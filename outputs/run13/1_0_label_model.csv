History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 69940**] is a 64 year old woman with HTN, RA, Type 2 DM admitted to OSH on [**1-10**] with confusion, chills, fevers to 103 and a week of green sputum found to have PNA on CXR, hypotension, and hypoxic respiratory failure. She was intubated in ED, started on dopamine, and transfered to the ICU. She ruled in for NSTEMI. She was switched to Norepinephrine (per cards) and hydrocort. She also received Xigris. Within 24 hours her HCT dropped from 35% to 28% and Xigris was stopped. Pt was initially on Ceftriaxone and Azithro which was changed to Levoquin Vanco and Clinda which was stopped on [**1-14**]. Due to possible [**Location (un) **] exposure, Doxycycline was also started. She went into A flutter with RVR and was cardioverted once unsuccessfully at the OSH. She was started on Diltiezem drip for rate control. For ? PCP PNA, she was started on high dose Bactrim as well. Throughout her OSH course she developed an increasing O2 requirment, and there was concern for ARDS with increasing difficulty in ventilation. Her last ABG on transfer was 7.30/45/51 sating 88% on 100%FiO2; IMVO 14; PEEP 8; Tv 700. She was transfered here for further management. . PCP: [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].

OSH MICRO DATA: Mycoplasma IgG - posative Blood Cx [**1-10**] - Gm posative cocci, speciation/sensis pending Legionella - negative Strep Pneumo antigen - negative RSV - negative Influenza A/B - negative . STUDIES: CXR - has large left pulmonary infiltrate . [**1-21**] CT abd/pelvis: 1. Uncomplicated pancreatitis with no evidence of abscess or fluid collection. 2. Pleural effusions, left greater than right, with consolidation in the right lower lobe consistent with pneumonia. 3. Old fractures of the pelvis.   Brief Hospital Course: # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure - Secondary to mycoplasma PNA for which she completed 14 day course of levofloxacin, evolved to ARDS from sepsis. Subsequently complicated by likely ventilator associated pneumonia, culture and bronchial lavage negative, empirically treated with a course of Vancomycin and Cefepime. Also, complicated by severe polyneuropathy from likely critical care neuropathy. NIF was measured and was in the 30s range. Pt was weaned to PS 5/0 on the 13th day of hospitalization and extubation was attempted. However the patient became increasingly tachypneic and agitated about 12 hours after extubation and was reintubated. Failure was thought to be due to respiratory muscle fatigue, poor underlying lung function in the context of pneumonia, possible component of volume overload. A tracheostomy was placed the next day as well as a PEG tube. She was successful with trach mask trials several days after trach placement on high flow O2.  She was successful for > 12hours daily, but on several occasions became tachypneic in the evening, thought to be influenced largely by anxiety rather than fatigue, requiring placement back on PS overnight.  She was, however, trialed for 24 hours on trach mask and was fatigued the following day requiring full 24 hours back on PS.  This was likely [**3-6**] to true respiratory muscle fatigue. . # PNA: From mycoplasma, treated with 14 day course of levofloxacin. Subsequently complicated by likely ventilator associated pneumonia, culture and bronchial lavage negative, empirically treated with a course of Vancomycin and Cefepime. . # Septic shock: Lactate on admission 2.3, hypotension, elevated WBC with 2 bands, tachypnea and tachycardia. Initially with pressor requirement. Initial broad spectrum Abx were discontinued once source of sepsis was found to be due to mycoplasma and a course of 14 days of Levofloxacin was completed. The patient also was treated with stress dose steroids initially, which were subsequently weaned to baseline Prednisone dose for chronic RA of 20mg. . # Clostridium difficile infection: diagnosed on [**1-22**]. Pt. will complete a 7 day (post other antibiotics) course of flagyl (flagyl course to be completed on [**2122-2-6**] after receiving her tid dosing that day). Diarrhea is much improved. . # Pancreatitis:  Thought [**3-6**] to propofol originally with elevated amylase and lipase.  Once her propofol was d/c'd, her amylase normalized.  Her lipase decreased, but remained elevated in the 150s.  Other LFTs were normal.  Her tube feeds were held transiently when her lipase failed to completely resolve and she had mild epigastric discomfort.  Given that her epigastric discomfort was post G tube placement, it resolved and tube feeds were reinitiated.  She did have high residuals so was not originally at goal.  Reglan was started and tube feeds were advanced.  She is now tolerating tube feeds at goal without reglan. . # Critical illness neuropathy: severe distal weakness, slight improvement towards the end of her hospital stay. EMG and nerve conduction studies showed mild, proximal myopathy with a superimposed geneneralized polyneuropathy, predominantly axonal. The picture is consistent with critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy.  Her strength has been consistently increasing, but deficit remains.  She will need continued physical therapy for this. . # Rash, eosinophilia:  During her course of cefepime and vancomycin she developed a rash and eosinophilia.  Once her 7 day course of cefepime and vanco was complete, her rash resolved although she remained mildly subjectively itchy requiring fexofenadine.  Her eosinophils remained elevated, but this also started to resolve.  There was no other clear drug source and suspiscion for infective cause was very low. . # Low grade fever: Intermittent low grade fever to Tmax of 100.2.  She has BAL, Urine and blood cultures pending from [**2122-2-5**], but suspiscion for infection is low given normal WBC count and no left shift on diff.  These cultures should be followed up. . # Rheumatoid arthritis:  Patient was transiently on stress dose steroids in the setting of sepsis.  Steroids were reduced to her home dose of 20mg PO prednisone with the resolution of sepsis. The need for PCP prophylaxis was discussed given chronically on 20mg prednisone daily.  The need for this dose in the setting of her RA and PCP prophylaxis was discussed with her rheumatologist and her dose of prednisone was decreased to 15mg po prednisone as she is not currently complaining of joint symptoms.  She was not started on bactrim while inpatient and if her chronic prednisone dose requirement increases, this should be readdressed.  Additionally, given her age, sex and chronic prednisone, she was started on vitamin D and calcium. . # Anemia with hct drop: HCT has been stable 24-26 from original drop from 29-31.  Anemia w/u included abd CT not revealing for bleed.  LDH is elevated, haptoglobin elevated as well, but this is in the setting of inflammation and, thus may not reflect accurately hemolysis.  Stools were guaiac negative.  Iron revealed normal iron, elevated ferritin, and low TIBC c/w ACD. . # Depression:  Patient has a history of depression and was on elavil previously.  She is not sure why this was discontinued originally.  While hospitalized, she was experiencing low mood and general anxiety.  Thus, celexa was started at 20mg daily on [**2122-1-31**].  This can be titrated as appropriate upon discharge. . # Hypertension: after hypotension in the context of sepsis has resolved, the patient hypertension which was controlled with Labetalol and Captopril.  She did require occasional fluid bolus in setting of negative fluid status and low UOP and transient hypotension, to which her BP responded well. . # A-Flutter: transient episodes in the context of high adrenergic state after acute sepsis resolved. Hemodynamically stable and was in NSR for > 1week prior to discharge, continued on BB. . # Steroid induced hypergylcemia: transiently on glargine, then changed to Regular SS only as steroids were weaned.  Her blood sugars have been well controlled.  She has not been requiring SS coverage, but this should be initiated if glucose control worsens.  # FEN: PEG tube in place. Tube feeds restarted after PEG tube placement on [**2122-1-29**]. . # PPx: Heparin SQ, PPI . # CODE: Full Code   Medications on Admission: MEDS on Transfer: Doxycycline 100mg [**Hospital1 **] Lopressor 2.5mg IV q4' and 5mg IV q6' ASA 81mg daily Zithromax 500mg IV Daily (started [**1-14**]- one dose given) Bactrim 400mg IV q8' (started [**1-14**]- one dose given) Solumedrol 60mg IV q6' (was 125mg IV q6hour until [**1-13**]) Fludrocortisone 0.1mg NGT Daily Reglan 5mg IV q8' Vancomycin 1gm IV q12' (started [**1-14**]- got one dose) Digoxin 0.125mg Daily NG since [**1-12**] Lovenox 40mg SC Daily Nexium 40mg Daily Lantus 20u SC daily Lopid 300mg via NG [**Hospital1 **] RISS Ativan PRN Tylenol ORN Morphine PRN Levaquin 500mg IV Daily (started [**1-10**])   Discharge Medications: 1.

No significant valvular abnormality.  CT (head): [**2105-4-28**] 13 x 16 mm left pontine hemorrhage. An MR should be obtained for further evaluation to rule out an underlying mass lesion.   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 29-year-old man with severe hypertension. He has undergone work-up by his primary care doctor, a renal physician and cardiology, without known cause. Hypertension appears to be familial, present in his father and sister, both from a young age. It is possible that whatever underlying predisposition he has is inherited in an autosomally dominant fashion, although this cannot be concluded given our limited knowledge of his pedigree. Further outpatient work-up seems warranted.  There was no underlying vascular malformation or other lesion from which this hemorrhage has arisen, at least at the resolution of CT. His compliance has been good but imperfect, so we think that his hemorrhage was most likely hypertensive during the exertions of sexual activity. As such, a primary goal has been to control his blood pressure, which is now quite adequate.   The hemorrhage was in the basis pontis on the left, with apparent vasogenic edema of the overlying tegmentum. Although there is not frank hemorrhage into the midline pontine tegmentum, edema and mass effect in this area most likely accounts for drowsiness. He initially demonstrated Troemner's and Babinksi's signs on the left, suggesting some mass effect to the right basis pontis, but this is now resolved. Eye movement abnormality is partially explained by lesion of the tract of the sixth nucleus, with nuclear sparing. In addition, adbuction to the right is incomplete and the reason for this is only speculative. He demonstrates loss of voluntary cough and swallow, with preservation of brisk involuntary cough, likely due to the effect of the lesion on the dorsal midline portion of basis pontis, with preserved nucleus ambiguus and lateral medulla.  Drowsiness resulted in intubation while at the scanner after arrival at the ED. He was extubated successfully on [**2105-4-28**], with some difficult managing secretion, but not oxygenation.  When extubated and with controlled pressure he was transferred to the neurology step-down unit. Atenolol was stopped and replaced with metoprolol tartrate given better 24 hour coverage and conversion to the succinate salt is intended at discharge.  After PEG placement he had desaturations to the low 80s and was sent back to the ICU. His CXR showed low lung volumes and the etiology was thought to be from the abdominal binder and restrictive lung disease. He was able to be weaned to trach mask with low O2 requirements and sent back to the floor. His blood pressure was stable for 48 hours prior to discharge in the 120s-130s systolic.  He will follow up in clinic with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

Admission CXR: IMPRESSION: 1. Left basilar consolidation representative of atelectasis or early pneumonia. 2. Small left pleural effusion. 3. Underlying apical emphysema. Right apical scarring. . [**2105-12-9**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly elongated. No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function. Distal septal hyopkinesis is suggested on some views, but could not be confirmed. Overall systolic function is normal (LVEF >60%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion without evidence for hemodynamic compromise. IMPRESSION: Mild aortic stenosis. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function. . [**2105-12-11**] CT CHEST:  IMPRESSION: 1. Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. Dense consolidation in the left lower lobe and lingula consistent with atelectasis and pneumonia. Scattered bilateral ground glass nodules likely represent infectious process. Limited evaluation for empyema due to lack of IV contrast. 2. Extensive calcifications of the aorta and its branches. 3. Compression fractures of the thoracic spine of indeterminate age. . [**2105-12-15**] REPEAT CT CHEST: IMPRESSION: As compared to the previous examination from [**12-11**], there is no major overall change in the extent of pleural effusions. Unchanged extensive left lower lobe consolidation. Regression of the pre-existing right than left apical opacities. Unchanged extensive coronary and aortic calcifications. No newly appeared pulmonary changes in the interval.   Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with history of HTN presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, found to have a LLL pneumonia. . # Sepsis/Pneumonia: Patient was admitted to the ICU on non-rebreather and acutely decompensated overnight.  She had hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation which was agreeable to her neice and HCP, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].  She became pressor dependent while intubated for pressures in the 60s/30s and went in to A-fib with RVR (see below).  She was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn on [**2105-12-7**] for HAP.  Sputum cx and bronchoscopy x2 failed to reveal infectious bacteria, but she was kept on these antibiotics given her respiratory status and pressor dependence.  After much discussion with HCP it was decided that she would not want trachiotomy or PEG tube and would prefer extubation, even if this leads to her demise.  The decision has been made to make pt??????s goals of care comfort oriented-  no further interventions, no heroic measures.  She eventually was weaned off pressors on [**2105-12-18**] and was extubated. She finished a 14 day course of Vanc and Zosyn on [**2105-12-20**]. Since then has been afebrile. Her code status was changed back to Full code.  # Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: resolved with 91-92%/RA. As above, patient was intubated from [**2105-12-8**] to [**2105-12-18**].  SHe continues to have incr plugging which has been treated with aggressive suctioning and chest PT.  Was on Vanc/Zosyn which ended on [**2105-12-20**].  She does continue to have a large left pleural effusion, and right effusion, without clear infectious etiology. This is most likely from CHF. It was unlikely that doing thoracentesis would help her with improved oxygenation and that the fluid would most likely reaccumulate from CHF. Also given her kyphotic posture, she would unlikely go over her current oxygen saturation level on room air. . # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Patient converted to A-fib with RVR during her hypoxic respiratory failure.  Her rate was initially controlled with IV diltiazem.  She was started on amiodarone gtt and converted to sinus on [**2105-12-9**].  She was transitioned to PO amiodarone for taper and will be tapered from 400mg [**Hospital1 **] to 400mg qday on [**2105-12-23**] which should last for 1 week, then be reduced to 200mg daily. . # Acute encephalopathy:  She developed change in mental status as a result of her prolonged ICU stay, and gradually cleared post extubation. . # Diastolic CHF, acute:  She developed bilateral pleural effusions and interstitial edema with fluid resuscitation.  She had an ECHO that showed a preserved EF.  Attempts were made at diuresis but were limited by her low intravascular volume. . # Hypernatremia: Sodium went up to almost 148 after diuresis. Diuresis was then held and she was given back fluid. She can be diuresed at rehab PRN. Also her sodium will need to be checked in [**3-15**] days to monitor. . # Diarrhea:  She developed diarrhea after antibiotic treatment was completed.  She had two negative cdiffs.  She was treated empirically with flagyl, which was discontinued after the c diff was negative. . # Goals of care:  This was discussed repeatedly with her HCP, who originally made her DNR/DNI when she was terminally extubated.  However, since she survived extubation, they chose to again make her full code.  This should continue to be addressed.

EMS activated, per records found patient unresponsive with no pulse, WCT ?VT noted. Patient was given defibrillation x1, noted ""sinus tachycardia"" 120 bpm post cardioversion.  Recorded SBP 86/p.  In [**Hospital1 18**] ER, patient subsequently urgently intubated secondary to respiratory distress.  ER concern for sepsis given hypotension, leukocytosis, and possible pneumonia, so ""code sepsis"" activated with placement of central venous lines, obtainment of cultures, and administration of antibiotic (vanc/levo/zosyn).  Patient given total 8 L IVF in ER, MAP ~65, started on norepinephrine vasopressor for hemodynamic support.  Transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further therapy, arriving intubated and sedated.  Per family, patient complained of ""cold-like"" symptoms for 5 days prior to admission.  Last contact 2 days before being found down.  Meds (in ER):  Vancomycin 1g, Zosyn, Levofloxacin, Decadron 6 mg IV.   Past Medical History: Largely unknown.

Nasogastric tube is coursing down below the left hemidiaphragm, and terminating in right upper quadrant. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits for age, given the positioning. Right costophrenic angle is not included. Patchy opacities are seen in bilateral lower lobes, which may represent atelectasis versus aspiration.  IMPRESSION: Tubes and lines as described above. Bibasilar patchy opacities, representing atelectasis or aspiration. . Head CT: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of hemorrhage. 2. There is white matter hypodensity near the trigone of the left lateral ventricle without extension to the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter that may represent sequela from chronic small vessel disease. 3.

[**Name (NI) **] had prodrome of cold-like symptoms per report. It is unclear what was the precipitant of the profound weakness / loss of consciousness, but concern exists for cardiac etiology in addition to infection / sepsis. The patient was not ""down"" for long (likely << 24h) given absence of profound volume depletion, minimal CK elevation. No evidence of trauma.  He was initially transferred to the ICU for treatment.  Hospital course is discussed by problem. . ID - Blood cultures were drawn, negative for growth.  Given the patient's low grade temperature elevation and leukocytosis, as well as the history of ""cold-like"" symptoms experienced by patient, pneumonia was thought to be the most likely source of infection.  An initial CXR demonstrated an early PNA consistent with aspiration, so he was started on empiric coverage with vancomycin/levofloxacin/Flagyl.  The patient went into respiratory distress secondary to sepsis/pneumonia, and the patient required intubation.  He was later successfully extubated. The patient rapidly improved and his lactate normalized.  His antibiotic coverage was narrowed to Levofloxacin only and finished a seven day course prior to discharge. . CV - Possible arrhythmic impetus (VT, less likely VF given period on floor) in setting of unknown history of vascular disease. An EKG demonstrates LBBB, which could be chronic and indicate significant CAD.  Given his NSTEMI, with troponin up to >3.0 and an index of 8, cardiology was consulted for further recommendations.  Given that the patient was shocked, hypotensive, and septic; this may have all contributed to the troponin elevation.  He underwent an echocardiogram with report as follows: 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. 2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is difficult to assess but is probably moderately depressed. Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed. 3. The aortic root is mildly dilated. 4. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is probably mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis. 5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. At least mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly underestimated.] He was started on a beta-blocker, aspirin, high dose Statin, and an ACE inhibitor for medical management.  In addition, a heparin drip was administered for 48 hours.  However, a few hours after the second dose of Captopril, the patient developed severe angioedema with lip and tongue swelling.  The patient was given Epi, Benadryl, IV steroids and ranitidine immediately, and anesthesia was consulted for possible intubation, as well as the ICU team.  The patient was transferred back to the ICU for airway monitoring, but was able to be medically managed without intubation.  Allergy service was consulted, and felt that this was consistent with an ACE-I allergy rather than a C-1 deficiency.  The C-1 assay was sent to rule out deficiency, with the results still pending at the time of discharge.  The patient's PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**], and a follow-up appointment with an outside cardiologist was arranged prior to discharge.  He was also started on Norvasc to help optimize his blood pressure control. . Renal- He was initially in acute renal failure, with a creatinine of 1.8 on admission.  Although his baseline was unknown, it resolved to 1.1.  His Foley was discontinued, and he urinated without difficulty.  A microalbumin was sent, which was negative, therefore initiating [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] was deferred by now. According to the allergy service, there is some risk of allergy with [**Last Name (un) **], although very low. . Endocrine- Given that he had a history of ""borderline"" diabetes, he was monitored with FS QID and covered with an ISS, particularly in the setting of steroids for angioedema.  A free T4 was normal, and a urine for microalbumin shows alb/creatinine ratio 27.6. . Heme- He was found to have anemia, normocytic, hct since admission 33-38, then improved to 40.  He was guaiac negative, and iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease. . He was evaluated by PT and was cleared for a home discharge with services.  His PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] prior to discharge, and the patient was scheduled for a follow-up appointment within one week of discharge.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the patient's severe exfoliative skin involvement with rapid progression and extensive involvement of the body, she was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring.  She was started on prophylactic Oxacillin to cover skin flora, and Dermatology was consulted along with Neurology and Ophthalmology for the ophthalmic involvement.  The patient's course in the Intensive Care Unit was uneventful, and she was discharged to the floor with very close monitoring which included q.1 hour Pred Forte application to the eye and close consultation with Ophthalmology.  With regard to her skin lesions, they continued exfoliate over the next couple of days, and her skin care included frequent Vaseline hydrated petroleum application to decrease insensible losses.  The patient's intake and output were closely monitored and replaced appropriately; however, the intensive nursing care requirement made it difficult for the patient to receive adequate on the floor, and therefore, she was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit again for frequent ophthalmic applications and skin care.  While in the MICU, the patient continued to have meticulous skin care and eye care.  The skin lesions continued to desquamate and exfoliate which is the natural progression of this disease.  She began to have involvement of the genital area with continued desquamation of the exfoliative lesions.  Her course in the Intensive Care Unit within the next 8-10 days was a slow but gradual improvement from a dermatologic and ophthalmologic standpoint.  From a cardiovascular standpoint, she was in sinus tachycardia which was felt to be secondary to her [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome leading to dehydration and insensible fluid losses.  While in the Intensive Care Unit, she was also found to be mildly hypoxic which is likely secondary to atelectasis because of the patient's immobility.  Lower extremity Dopplers were also done, and no deep venous thromboses were found.  From and Infectious Disease standpoint, the patient was started on intravenous Oxacillin empirically.  Blood cultures on the 5th was with no growth times two; however, one bottle from her PICC line grew out gram-positive cocci on [**7-27**]. She was started on a course of Vancomycin.  Subsequently the organism was found to be CNS with Corynebacterium, and Vancomycin was discontinued prior to transfer to the floor on [**8-5**].  The patient's course on the floor was uncomplicated with continued improvement.  Dermatology:  The patient, as indicated, improved dramatically from her presentation to the time of discharge. Her exfoliative lesions healed over the course of this admission.  Her skin care requirements decreased to Petroleum jelly twice a day at the time of discharge.  She was able to take in oral foot without problems.  Ophthalmology:  The patient's eye care requirement improved markedly.  She was able to open her eyes and use her vision without significant problems at the time of discharge.  Her Pred Forte was discontinued on the day of discharge, and she is to have follow-up with Ophthalmology a couple of days after discharge.  Fluid, electrolytes, and nutrition:  On admission the patient was begun on TPN for nutritional support.  As the patient improved from a medical perspective, her TPN was weaned, and at the time of discharge, the patient was taking adequate p.o. with supplementation of Boost.  Infectious Disease:  At the time of admission, she was started on empiric antibiotics and placed on contact precautions secondary to her extensive skin lesions; however, as the patient improved throughout the course of this admission, contact precautions were discontinued, and the patient was discharged home with services.  Cardiology/Pulmonology:  The patient was tachycardiac throughout this admission which was attributed to her fluid losses secondary to [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome; however, given the patient's immobility throughout the course of this admission, a CT angiogram was performed to evaluate for possible pulmonary embolism, and none were found.  Neurology:  The patient has a history of cystic tumor status post resection in [**Month (only) 205**] of this year and was started on prophylactic Dilantin leading to presumed [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome.  At the time of this admission, the patient's Dilantin was discontinued, and no other anticonvulsants were started, given the patient's risk of seizures several weeks after her surgery was unlikely.  This decision was made with the support of her neurosurgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1338**].  Five days before discharge, the patient did have a syncopal event while in the bathroom showering with the help of a nursing aide.  The likely etiology of this is orthostatic hypotension from her fluid losses; however, given the patient's neurologic history, Neurology was consulted to evaluate for possible seizure.  Neurology's recommendations were to obtain a repeat CT scan which was unchanged from previous showing a right frontal lobe extra-axial hypodensity which was stable.  They also recommended repeat MR imaging which was again unremarkable except for a stable extra-axial lesion noted on CT scan.  Neurology therefore agrees with the primary team that the syncopal event was likely secondary to a vasovagal reaction.  A follow-up MR scan would be recommended with gadolinium to evaluate for the presence of residual tumor.  This can be done as an outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1338**].  Rehabilitation:  The patient throughout this admission worked with our physical therapy people and continued to improve with regard to range of motion and strength in the upper and lower extremities, and by the time of discharge, she was ambulating throughout the [**Doctor Last Name **] and around the hospital without problems.  She was therefore discharged home without need for Physical Therapy Services.  At the time of discharge, the patient has markedly improved from her initial presentation and is to be discharged home with nursing assistance.  DISCHARGE STATUS:  Markedly improved.  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1.  [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome secondary to Dilantin. 2.  Status post craniotomy on [**2109-7-1**], for a cystic cranial lesion, likely dysembryoplastic angioneural epithelial lesion with features consistent with an oligodendroglioma.  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Polysporin ophthalmology O.U. q.i.d., hydrated Petroleum as needed, Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d., Nystatin, Boost t.i.d.  FOLLOW-UP:  1.  Ophthalmology [**2109-8-20**], at 12:45 p.m.  2.  Primary care physician in two weeks.  3. Dermatology as needed.  DISCHARGE NOTE:  PLEASE NOTE THAT THE PATIENT IS ALLERGIC TO DILANTIN AND TEGRETOL GIVEN HER [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] SECONDARY TO DILANTIN.  The patient is recommended to wear an alert bracelet which indicates this reaction.

Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 88836**] was a same day admission to the operating room for a scheduled aortic valve replacement. Please see the operative report for details,in summary she had: Aortic valve replacement with a 21mm [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**] tissue valve. Her cardiopulmonary bypass time was 57 minutes with a crossclamp time of 42 minutes. She tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the operating room to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition with minimal vasopressor support. She remained hemodynamically stable in the immediate post-op period, her anesthesia was reversed, she woke neurologically intact and was extubated. On POD1 she was transferred from the cardiac surgery ICU too the stepdown floor for continued post-op care. All tubes lines and drains were removed per cardiac surgery protocol. She was transfused one unit PRBC for post-op anemia. She reports postoperative intermittent visual changes, lasting only seconds. No focal defecit appreciated. As discussed with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **], Ms.[**Known lastname 88836**] will alert the cardiac surgery service if these symptoms persist. Dr[**Last Name (STitle) **] office will also follow up in 1 week after discharge to ascertain whether Ms.[**Known lastname 88836**] will require an outpatient eval by Neuro and/or Opthamologist. The remainder of her hospital course was uneventful. She worked with nursing and physical therapy to increase her strength and endurance. By POD# 5 she was ready for discharge home with visiting nurses. She is to follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 1week at wound clinic and at 1 month in cardiac surgery clinic.

No  evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or acute large vascular territorial infarction.  TTE [**2108-2-28**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to extensive akinesis involving the apex and anterior septum; there is severe hypkinesis of the anterior free wall, inferior septum, and inferior free wall. The basal half of the posterior and lateral walls contracts normally. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.  Impression: extensive anteroseptal-apical myocardial infarct of unknown acuity; inferior hypokinesis; findings consistent with multivessel obstructive coronary [**Last Name (un) **] disease  EEG [**2108-3-5**]: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. Throughout the recording, the background was one of burst suppression alternating between frequent sharp generalized triphasic waves at a maximum frequency of 2 Hz to a more suppressed pattern of suppression of the background for periods of up to eight seconds alternating with bursts of low amplitude activity. In the recent past those triphasic appearing waves probably represent short electrographic seizures.   Brief Hospital Course: In brief this is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest.  # Asystolic arrest: Most likely respiratory arrest. Initially started on cooling protocol but this was stopped for elevated INR. Since admission he remained nonresponsive with fixed and dilated pupils. He was intubated and remained so for the duration of the hospitalization. Daily spontaneous breathing trials were negative. Trach was placed and his care was transitioned to a ventilatory rehab facitlity.  # Hypotension: he was noted to be hypotensive in the ED and was given IVF and started on pressor support with norepinephrine. He was waned of this medication and was able to mantain his BP. An ECHO was obtained showing EF20% hypokinetic LV and PCWP elevated. This is suggestive of systolic sysfunction and suggest a cardiac etiology of hypotension. He was gradually weaned off pressors and maintained a normal BP (90-120 systolic) for several days. His tamsulosin was held.  # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and recent antibiotic use. No evidence of DIC. This was reversed with vitamin K and FFP. He was then placed on hep gtt when his inr was subtherapeutic. After the trach and peg he was restarted on coumadin. He will be bridged back onto coumadin at the ventilatory rehab center in [**1-3**] days. Goal INR 2.5-3.5.  # h/o [**Date Range 1291**]: on heparin ggt for thrombus ppx. Transition to warfarin with heparin bridge for 2 days at INR>2.5.  # Neurological disturbances: As noted he was unrespionsive to verbal and painfull comands. Initially his pupils were fixed and dilated. He was placed on EEG and a head CT showed small vessel ischemic disease and global parenchymal atrophy. No evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or acute large vascular territorial infarction. His EEG identified foci of seizure activity, which occurred with concurrent uncontrolled muscle movement suggesting a seizure. Neurology followed the paitent. He was started on Keppra and this was uptitrated to effect (i.e absence of seizure activity on exam and EEG). During his stay he exbited some change in neuro exam, in that he was minimally responsive to pain and pupils more reactive. However this was very short lasted (one day) and subsequently he was again nonresponsive.  # Acute renal failure: Initially he was noted to have an elevated creatinine of 2.1 from 1.o in recent months. Also this was associated with oligouria. This improved with pressure support and diuresis, suggestive that the renal failure was related to decreased forward cardiac output.  # Longitudinal care: Palliative care consult obtained and several meettings were held with family members and spiritual leader. Decision to mantain ventilatory support unless evidence of worsening multiple organ failure.  # Foot Ulceration: Noted severe ulcers on right foot, consistent with prior documented note by vascular surgery (tendons exposed). Continued wound care.  # Nutritional support: provided through tube feeds during his hospitalization. PEG tube placed for future support.  # Complicated UTI: on cefpodoxime (h/o proteus and enterococcus in urine sensitive to CTX - not cipro). End date [**2108-3-11**].  # Access: PICC was placed for administration of IV medications.   # Indwelling devices: Trach, PEG, PICC   Medications on Admission: Acetaminophen prn Bisacodyl prn Oxycodone prn Glyburide 2.5 mg daily Docusate prn Duloxetine 30 mg daily Tramadol 25 mg prn Tamsulosin 0.4 mg qhs Warfarin  Discharge Medications: 1.

On arrival to the ER she was found to have temp 101.0, HR 126, bp 180/86, and to be satting 82% on RA which improved to mid-90s on 4LNC.  Chest XR showed continued and possibly increased R pleural effusion.  She complained of midl abdominal pain, and CT abd/pelvis was unremarkable except for known enlarged gallbladder.  She was given 1LNS, vanco and levo and was sent to HD where they were able to remove 1.2L.  While at HD, the patient spontaneously desaturated to the 80s on 4LNC and required 50% face mask to regain sats of the mid-90s.  ABG at that time showed 7.36/58/271.  Stat CXR showed R pleural effusion but no clear pna.  She received nebs and zosyn and was transferred to the MICU for further care. . In the MICU the patient had a bedside ultrasound to evaluate her effusion which showed no safe area for diagnostic tap.  After a few hours in the MICU she dropped her pressures to as low as sbp78. She was given 1500cc total of NS. Central line was placed in a sterile fashion (LIJ) and she was started on levophed.  Her blood cultures returned 4/4 bottles GPC in clusters.

Once sensitivities returned as MRSA, the zosyn was discontinued.  Her blood pressures were low on initial presentation so the patient was given bolus IV fluids and levophed.  Her CVP was maintained above 8.  She was eventually weaned off of the levophed.  An extensive workup for the source of infection was limited by patient's wishes.  She had a TTE which was negative but refused an MRI of the spine.  The patient was afebrile during the ICU course.  Surveillance cultures were negative after [**2114-11-14**]. She will receive long duration therapy with 6wks of Vancomycin to cover for osteomyelitis, as she has had this in the past. Her most recent vanco level was pending at time of discharge. . #Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia:  The patients platlet count continued to fall during her ICU stay.  Heparin products were held and sent off HIT Ab labs which eventually came back positive.  Her central line was also discontinued which was pre-treated with heparin. . #ESRD:  The patient has ESRD and received dialysis through her fistula while in the MICU.  No complications.  Last dialysis was on [**2114-11-22**].  Pt required extra sessions of dialysis because of HD-related hypotension, which limited the extent of dialysis that could be done in one session.

CXR ([**2145-1-24**]): Comparison with the previous study done [**2145-1-20**]. There are extensive parenchymal and pleural changes consistent with end-stage sarcoidosis as before. An endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remain in place. Allowing for differences in technique, there is no significant change. No significant interval change. . CXR ([**2145-2-3**]): Previously questioned retrocardiac nodular infection has cleared, presumably representing secretions resolved from a region of cystic lung. In all other respects the radiographic appearance of these severely scarred and bronchiectatic lungs, as well as bilateral pleural abnormalities are unchanged over the long-term. There are no findings to suggest acute pneumonia or pulmonary edema.   Brief Hospital Course: 76 yo male with end stage sarcoidosis presenting with dyspnea. . # HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt presented to the ER with increased shortness of breath over 24hrs, tachycardia, and generalized fatigue. Similar prior presentations were felt to be related to sarcoid flares. CXR showed end stage pulmonary fibrosis but no other abnormalities. It was felt his sx likely represented pneumonia in setting of severe underlying fibrotic lung disease. Pt was unable to sustain high minute ventilatory rate, evidenced by a rising pCO2 and thus required emergent intubation shortly after arrival to ICU. The patient was treated for presumed pneumonia with levofloxacin and meropenem given leukocytosis and dyspnea. Infectious work-up including multiple blood cultures and viral cultures were negative.  The patient was not given steroids since it was felt that his sx were related to an infectious process rather than a flair of his sarcoid lung disease. The patient was made DNR after talking with the son. IP consult was sought for trach placement given the patient's inability to wean off the ventilator with subsequent placement of tracheostomy and PEG on [**1-26**] and [**1-27**] respectively. Pt tolerated trach mask well. He was transferred to the floor on [**2-3**]. Later that afternoon he was noted to desat into the 50's with increased work of breathing and was requiring high levels of nursing care. He was transferred back to the MICU where he again experienced agitation and increased work of breathing. He was placed back on the vent on PS overnight and tolerated this well and eventually was able to transition to trach mask throughtout the day and night. Clinical decompensation attributed to mucus plugging.  # CHRONIC ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION: Pt normotensive on admission to ICU. His home medications of midodrine and fludricortisone were continued while admitted.  # Agitation: The patient had issues with agitation especially at night. Geriatrics was consulted and a regimen of Seroquel was initiated as well as efforts to limit lines and to orient him frequently. His mental status waxed and waned and he fell out of bed twice but sustained no injuries. By [**2-1**] his delirium had improved on a regimen of seroquel to 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **], seroquel 25 mg QHS and Seroquel 25mg prn. Upon readmission to the MICU, however, he again became significantly agitated and required IV haldol in addition to his scheduled seroquel. EKG the following morning did not show any eveidence of prolonged QT.  Per geriatric recommendations the pt's seroquel was increased to 50mg qhs and his sundowning improved. QTc was noted to 419 on discharge dose of seroquel. . The patient was on SubQ heparin for DVT prophylaxis and PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis. Communication was with the patient and his [**Last Name (LF) 802**], [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 2013**] ([**Name (NI) 802**]) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 97950**]. Code status was DNR/DNI, confirmed with HCP. . # Malnutrition: He failed swallowing test twice with concern for aspiration.  PEG tube was placed and his tube feeds were advanced to goal rate of 35 cc/hr.  Medium chain trigylcerides were added for coloric help. . Follow up at Rehab 1. Sundowning: [**Month (only) 116**] increase his schedule dose of seroquel [**Hospital1 **] and qhs. His QTc on current dose is only 419.  Please check EKG after increasing his dose to ensure there is no significant QTc prolongation.  Medications on Admission: 1. Fludrocortisone 0.1 mg DAILY 2. Tamsulosin 0.4 mg HS 3.

CXR 4.17: FINDINGS: Heart size unchanged. Right upper lobe opacification and right mediatinal fullness corresponds to thick walled upper lobe cavity and mediastinal lymphadenopathy with differential including Wegener's, SCC/cancer, and fungal infection. No new focus of consolidation is seen. There is no effusion or pneumothorax. IMPRESSION: Unchanged highly abnormal chest radiograph. . MRI Head [**5-29**]: IMPRESSION: Multiple enhancing lesions are identified in the brain as described above. Although metastatic disease is a consideration, given the restricted diffusion on the diffusion-weighted images, infection needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis. The appearances could also be secondary to multiple tuberculomas given a cavitary lesion in the lung. . CT Torso [**5-30**]: IMPRESSION: 1. Findings consistent with extensive metastatic disease, including pulmonary nodules, bilateral adrenal masses, and bilateral renal masses. Lymphadenopathy in mediastinal, right greater than left hilar, retroperitoneal, and mesenteric locations, consistent with nodal spread of neoplastic disease. Bronchoscopic biopsy is recommended. 2. Cavitary pulmonary nodule in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, suspicious for primary lung carcinoma. Please see the differential discussion in the prior chest CTA report for less likely considerations. 3. Right upper lobe pulmonary interstitial thickening, suspicious for lymphangetic spread. 4. Subtle sclerosis in the T4 vertebral body. While indeterminate, osseous metastasis is not excluded. If there will be a change in clinical management, then a bone scan may be helpful. 5. Wedge-shaped peripheral opacity in the right middle lobe, evolving since the prior chest CTA. Second evolving process in the right upper. While these may be secondary to infection, the morphology of the right middle lobe opacity raises the possibility of a pulmonary infarct. 6. Aberrant right subclavian artery. . Head CT [**5-30**](post-bx): IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes from recent resection of the left frontal lesion with minimal high attenuation in the resection bed and moderate perilesional vasogenic edema causing effacement of the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle without shift of midline structures. . ECHO [**2184-6-1**] Conclusions The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: No valveular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Normal biventricular cavity sizes and regiona/global systolic function. . [**2184-6-4**] CT head IMPRESSION: Extensive bilateral areas of vasogenic edema, from known brain metastasis. Compared to [**2184-5-30**], the overall appearance is not significantly changed. . Labs on discharge: ***************   Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after complaints of nausea, vomiting, and not ""feeling herself"".  Of significance, she is status post diagnosis of lung mass for which she was being worked up on an outpatient basis. . 1. NSCLC, metastatic to brain/nausea/vomiting/headache -- Upon admission a head CT was performed which identified multiple infra and supra tentorial brain lesions, including the brain stem.  High dose steroid therapy was initiated to treat associated vasogenic edema.  A left stereotactic brain biopsy was performed on [**5-30**].  Post-operatively a head CT was done, and determined to be stable.  She was then returned to the ICU pending diagnosis and further management.  She was initiated on whole brain radiation on [**2184-6-2**] and was monitored in the ICU for signs and symptoms of increased ICP.  She was subsequently transferred to the hospitalist service for the remainder of her course. During initiation of her brain radiation treatments, patient had intractable nausea, vomiting, headache, and hypertension, but repeat CT head did not show increased edema.  She continued on IV dexamethasone 6 mg q6 hours, IV keppra 1000mg q12 hours, and IV hydralazine for blood pressure control (see below). For nausea control, she was kept on compazine, zofran, ativan, phenergen PRN. Oncology, neuro-oncology, and neurosurgery was involved throughout her hospital course.  Her symptoms gradually subsided and she was transitioned to po meds.  She will complete the remainder of her radiation treatments as an outpatient.  She has follow up scheduled with thorcaic oncology and neuro-oncology. . 2. Hypertension -- While unable to tolerate po, she was treated with IV hydralazine for goal SBP of less than 130 mmHg.  When able to tolerate po, she was transitioned to Lisinopril.  The patient was instructed to followup with her PCP regarding her blood pressure. . 3. Asthma -- remained stable throughout her course, continued prn albuterol. . 4. Hyperglycemia -- associated with high dose steroids and managed with a sliding scale without difficulty. . 5.

She initially presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital with a complaint of progressive shortness of breath. She also reported a 20-30 pound weight loss, gradual abdominal distention and bilateral lower extremity swelling.  She was found to have a large right pleural effusion and underwent a 2.5 L thoracentesis, with negative cytology. The patient also had a paracentesis with negative cytology at the OSH. CT torso on [**10-20**] showed bilateral pulmonary opacities, diffuse lymphadenopathy, ascities, and ovarian masses.  Ultrasound on [**2107-10-21**] showed bilateral pelvic soft tissue masses with ascites and normal uterus. CA-125 was elevated at greater than 2500. She was then transferred to the gyn-onc service for further management. . Patient underwent TAH/BSO, and ascites drainage.  Right pelvic lymph node was sent for frozen section which was found to be consistent with lymphoma.  The right ovarian mass was found to be benign.  Multiple enlarged lymph noes were found, the largest was over 5 cm.  Intraoperatively, she received 1 L IVF and was bolused subsequently for low UOP and for post-operative hypotension.     Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for ongoing treatment. . Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient was intubated and mildly sedated, VS: BP 84/52 MAP 65 HR 88 O2 sat 95% on AC. Central line was placed under ultrasound guidance in the right IJ. While in the ICU, she was put on up to 3 pressors for her hypotension.  She went into acute renal failure (thought to be from hypotension-related ATN with a possible component of tumor lysis syndrome from steroid-induced lysis) requiring CVVH and rasburicase.  She was successfully taken off CVVH and extubated. She was diuresed aggressively for a 20L net positive fluid status since her ICU admission.  Her abdominal wound was draining up to 1L/day.  Also while in the ICU, she was noted to have an EF of 20%,; it is unclear if this is from an MI in the setting of hypotension or if it is just ""shocked"" myocardium. . After her acute issues stabilized, the patient was transferred to 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] for further management.   Past Medical History: none  Social History: The patient smoked one pack per day for 30 years, but currently does not smoke. She drinks occasionally. She is married and has two daughters and one son from a previous marraige.   Family History: colon cancer  Physical Exam: Upon arrival in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]: GEN: sedated, intubated. not responsive to voice or noxious stimuli HEENT: PERRL CV: distant heart sounds, nl s1, s2, no m/r/g Pulm: CTA anteriorly Abd: midline abdominal dressing clean and intact. obese, nontender, hypoactive bowel sounds.

CT scan [**2107-11-4**] for lymphoma staging: There is mildly heterogeneous and enlarged thyroid gland with a small 1-cm hypodense nodule within the right lobe. There are multiple nodes present within the mediastinum, the largest of which is seen within the paraesophageal space measuring 16 mm in diameter. There are bilateral enlarged hilar lymph nodes which cannot be definitely measured given lack of IV contrast. There is marked axillary lymphadenopathy with a representative node on the right measuring 20 x 18 mm and is seen on series 2, image 6. A representative node within the left axilla is seen on series 2, image 8, measuring 16 x 12 mm. There are multiple tiny nodules seen within the breasts bilaterally, the largest on the left hand side measuring 12 x 15 mm, seen on series 2, image 16. There are bilateral large pleural effusions. The lungs are otherwise clear. Along the right thorax just below the scapula, there is a moderate amount of air within the subcutaneous and intramuscular space, probably sequelae from prior thoracentesis. The heart and great vessels are unremarkable. There is a 27 x 15 mm node along the right pericardium measuring 15 x 27 mm, seen on series 2, image 36. The patient is intubated and has a nasogastric tube extending with tip in the post-pyloric region.  CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is a moderate amount of ascites. The liver is unremarkable. The gallbladder wall is thickened likely secondary to third spacing. The pancreas is not clearly defined but appears grossly unremarkable. The spleen is prominent, slightly displacing the stomach medially 12 x 7 cm. The adrenal glands are not well visualized secondary to an extensive amount of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy extending from the level of the SMA inferiorly and encasing the aorta and IVC. A representative size of this conglomeration is seen on series 2, image 74 measuring 86 x 52 mm. There is extensive lymphadenopathy within the mesentery with a conglomerate of nodes measuring 57 x 40 mm, seen on series 2, image 85. There is a moderate amount of ascites. The small and large bowel are unremarkable and opacified with oral contrast extending to the rectum. There is no evidence of obstruction.  CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder is catheterized. The rectum is unremarkable. The uterus is not well visualized. There are no adnexal masses with the exception of extensive lymphadenopathy that extends into the deep pelvis bilaterally inferiorly from the above-mentioned retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy along the iliac nodal chains. The largest bulk of this lymphadenopathy measures 94 x 47 mm along the left iliac nodal chain seen on series 2, image 105. There is extensive inguinal lymphadenopathy, the largest nodal conglomerate seen on the left measuring 49 x 62 mm.  Also noted within the subcutaneous tissue in the midline of the abdomen are a few pockets of air seen along a linear soft tissue defect likely secondary to prior surgical intervention.  BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions. . Echo ([**2107-11-2**]): The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the distal 2/3rds of the ventricle. Basal segments contract well. The apex is milldy aneurysmal and akinetic, but no masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle, though the apex is trabeculated. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There is focal akinesis of the apical half of the RV free wall. The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.  Repeat echo prior to R-CHOP ([**12-5**]): The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and  cavity size are normal. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the distal 2/3rds of the ventricle. Basal segments contract well. The apex is milldy aneurysmal and akinetic, but no masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle, though the apex is trabeculated. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There is focal akinesis of the apical half of the RV free wall. The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.  Abdominal Ultrasound ([**11-24**]): There are again identified bilateral pleural effusions, partially imaged. There is a moderate-to-large amount of ascites present in all four quadrants, best appreciated in the left lower quadrant. In the left lobe of the liver there are two uniformly hyperechoic lesions, the largest of which measures 2.0 x 1.6 x 1.7 cm with appearance consistent with hemangiomas. No other focal abnormalities are demonstrated within the liver. The gallbladder is collapsed with likely wall thickening again, which could be secondary to third spacing of fluid. A shadowing gallstone is demonstrated within the gallbladder lumen. The spleen is stable in size measuring 11 cm in its longest length. A small roughly 1 cm anechoic lesion, without blood flow is demonstrated within the spleen, not fully characterized on this study, though possibly a cyst. The previously described extensive mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy is not well assessed on this study.  Color flow and Doppler evaluation of the hepatic vasculature was performed given history of ascites. The hepatic veins, hepatic arteries main portal vein and its branches are patent with appropriate direction of flow and normal waveforms. The inferior vena cava is generally narrowed without intraluminal filling defects. This appearance could be secondary to fluid status or secondary to ascites. . CTA ([**12-2**]): 1. There is a large right pleural effusion with complete passive collapse of the right lung. There is a small left pleural effusion. 2. Again seen is mediastinal and pericardial lymphadenopathy, which is not significantly changed in comparison to the prior study. 3. A large amount of ascites. 4. Three hypodensities are seen within the visualized portion of the liver which are not completely characterized. . . CYTOLOGY: Pleural Fluid: By immunohistochemical stains, the lymphocytes are a mixture of CD20 positive B-cells along with CD3 positive (B greater than T). Although definite co-expression of CD5 amongst B-cells could not be discerned, a subset of weak CD5 expressing cells is seen amongst the brighter CD5 positive T-cells.  Scattered CD10 positive lymphocytes are seen. Bcl-1/cyclin D1 is expressed in a minor subset.  Overall, the findings indicate involvement by the patient's known Mantle cell lymphoma.  Peritoneal Fluid: Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to optimize lymphocyte yield. Abnormal/lymphoma cells comprise 5% of lymphoid gated events.  B cells demonstrate a monoclonal Lambda light chain restricted population.  They co-express pan-B cell markers CD19 along with CD5 and FMC-7.  They do not express any other characteristic antigens including CD10, CD23. A subset express CD20. T cells express mature lineage antigens.  INTERPRETATION Findings are of involvement by a Lambda restricted, CD5-positive B cell lymphoproliferative disorder, immunophenotypically consistent with patient's known mantle cell lymphoma.  Given the small percentage of involved B-cells, peripheral blood contamination cannot be ruled out.   Brief Hospital Course: 1. See HPI for MICU course . 2. Mantle Cell Lymphoma:  Received 300mg/m2 of Cytoxan twice a day for six doses, with high-dose Decadron.  The decadron was discontinued after the patient developed psychotic paranoia. She developed tumor lysis syndrome with elevated uric acid, and initially requiring CVVH.  Her counts dropped in response to chemotherapy and she was neutropenic for several days.  The patient was treated with neupogen until her counts normalized, and she remained afebrile.  Her effusions (below) continued to re-accumulate after taps, and ultimately the decision was made to treat the patient with the first round of R-CHOP.  She tolerated the regimen very well, and had no issues completing the prednisone portion of the therapy.  The patient was transfused to keep her hematocrit above 25 and platelets above 10. . 3. Malignant effusion:  The patient originally presented with shortness of breath from a right pleural effusion and ascites. Her ascites fluid was drained in the operating room, and not sent for studies.  Her right pleural effusion was tapped twice, both large volume.  Cytology was positive for lymphoma.  The patient had reaccumulation of both fluid collections, which were unintervenable while she was neutropenic.  Once her counts recovered, the patient underwent therapeutic paracentesis of 3 liters, which demonstrated malignant cells.  The patient remained short of breath after this procedure and underwent a 1.6 liter thoracentesis by interventional pulmonary.  She tolerated the procedure well with immediate symptomatic improvement. On a post-procedure x-ray, however, her right lung remained [**Last Name (un) 57454**]-out. She underwent CTA which demostrated a very large right pleural effusion with right lung collapse.  The patient, however, had an improvement in her symptoms and decrease in her oxygen requirement.  She underwent R-CHOP in an effort to treat the underlying cause of her effusions.  She was discharged on 40 po Lasix to take daily, to which she responded well in the hospital. . 4. s/p TAH-BSO: The patient was originally thought to have ovarian cancer, and she underwent TAH-BSO on [**2107-11-1**].  The diagnosis of lymphoma was made on an intraoperative lymph node biopsy.  Her ovarian pathology was cystadenofibroma. . 5. Cardiomyopathy: In the ICU, her ejection fraction was found to be 20%, which is likely ischemic in origin from ""shocked"" myocardium.  Repeat TTE, when her critical illness resolved revealed an ejection fraction of 55%, but persistent right sided failure. Prior to beginning treatment with R-CHOP, the patient again had an echocardiogram which demonstrated resolution of the right heart failure and 2+ MR. . 6.  ID:  the patient had asymptomatic pyruia on [**11-14**], and was treated for 7 days with Zosyn for a Citrobacter UTI.  Repeat urine culture was negative.  She remained afebrile while neutropenic. . 7. Chronic back pain: MRI demonstrated no spinal or vertebral involvement of her lymphoma.  She was maintained on narcotics for pain control.  As her ascites reaccumulated, her pain medication requirement increased.  She was discharged on 10 mg Oxycontin [**Hospital1 **] and 5 mg Oxycodone q4 prn.  MRI revealed no spinal involvement of her lymphoma . 8. Disposition: The patient will go to rehabilitation to assist her after her prolonged hospitalization and very low functional status at this point.  Patient had a port placed by surgery on [**2107-11-17**], which was functional through the hospitalization.  She was full code.  Medications on Admission: hnone  Discharge Medications:   1.

Patient recently began ixabepilone chemotherapy on [**2193-5-2**] and since that time reports increased vaginal discharge, which she describes as ""yellow and brown debris.""  States that she has been using about 2 pads per day, soaking through each, and that discharge is ""liquidy"" in character.  This is an entirely new symptom for her.  Also about one week ago patient noticed that her stoma ""looked different.""  It seemed retracted into her abdominal wall, and there was increased ""light pink bubbles"" at the opening.  She went to see her ostomy nurse on day prior to admission who told her to come into the hospital if she developed fevers, chills, or increased abdominal pain.  Ms. [**Known lastname 45419**] woke up with these symptoms on day of admission and came to the ED.  At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, patient had a CT which showed a small rectal stump leak, locule of air near staple line of [**Doctor Last Name **] pouch, and a colovaginal fistula, which had likely been developing over the course of weeks (and was not likely the cause of her current symptoms).  Surgery was consulted and they felt that given the contained leak and proximity of likely residual tumor, there were no good (or safe) surgical options.  It was recommended that patient be treated with antibiotic coverage and remain NPO for the time being.  In the ED initial vitals were: 100 136 134/77 20 100. Patient was given vancomycin 1g, cefepime and metronidazole 500mg.  Mag was noted to be 1.2 and patient given 2g.  Na was 128 (131 on repeat) and k was 5.6 (4.2 on repeat).  WBC 23.  Also given 6L of fluid.  Patient remained tachy into the 130, SBP 97-120.  A U/A revealed trace modertate blood, trace leuks and glucosuria. Zofran and tylenol were given symptomatically.  On transfer, BP was 125/80, HR 120, and she was satting 99%RA.  ROS:  Chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain in LLQ.  Negative for headache, trouble swallowing, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, dysuria, or any other concerning signs or symptoms.  Past Medical History: Past Oncologic history: [**Known firstname **] is 43 yo woman with advanced ovarian ca. She is s/p debulking surgery and hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy. She received iv and intraperitoneal chemotherapy as part of her adjuvant chemotherapy ending in [**2193**]7. She was enrolled in study getting oral [**Doctor Last Name 360**] AZD2171 until [**12-11**]. She resumed tx with single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] [**Doctor Last Name **] as of [**2191-5-12**]; but had reaction with dose 6/08. Started doxil [**2191-7-21**].

Locules of gas near the staple line of the Hartmann's pouch; it is unclear if it is intra- or extra-luminal, infectious process at this site not excluded. No evidence of parastomal collection. 4. Gallbladder sludge without evidence of acute cholecystitis. 5. Bilateral hydronephrosis, stable from previous study. 6. Hepatic hypodensity, concerning for metastasis.  [**5-26**] KUB FINDINGS: Gas and stool are seen throughout the colon to the region of the splenic flexure. Gas is seen in some mildly dilated loops of small bowel measuring up to 4 cm, without air-fluid level. This likely represents an ileus.  UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.   Brief Hospital Course: 43 yo femaled with advanced ovarian cancer, was admitted with complaints of fever, chills, and was found to have SIRS/septic shock, and was initially managed in the ICU.  She was started on empiric coverage with broad spectrum antibiotics.  She was found to be bacteremic with strep anginosus, which is likely d/t intrabdominal fisulization/abscesses. A CT of her abdomen and pelvis (without contrast due to allergy) showed significantly worsening ovarian cancer, colovaginal fistulization, and possible microperforation vs infection at her [**Doctor Last Name 3379**] pouch. She clinically stabilized, however further discussion with her oncologist and surgeon revealed that there are no further therapeutic options to offer, and she is not a candidate for surgery. Her primary oncologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She was transitioned to DNR/DNI, and she elected to go home with hospice care.  Her blood cultures later revealed strep anginosus (milleri), and her antibiotics were changed to oral flagyl and levofloxacin, as she prefered an oral regimen for palliation.  At the time of discharge, she was still having low-grade temps, but seh was not symptomatic from them.  She will complete a 2 week course of antibiotics on [**2193-6-5**]. . * Colovaginal fistula - She has a known colovaginal fistula, however there are no surgical options per GynOnc discussion.  It does appear that her vaginal discharge may be improving slightly with antibiotic treatment. . * LLE Edema - She was noted to have some left sided edema (LLE/LUE). THere was intially concern for possible DVT, however LENI;s were negative.  The edema is most likely related to = tumor blocking lymphatic drainage. Elevation and LLE compression hose were recommended for comfort. . * Ovarian cancer - Per primary oncologist, pt has no further chemotherapy options. Transitioned to DNR/DNI and palliative care consulted and assisted throughout the hospitalization. -- Patient is being discharged to home with hospice . * DM - Pt had several episodes of hypoglycemia on lantus due to decreasing oral intake. Her lantus dose was serially downtitrated. Tight glucose control not necessary at this time, but would like to avoid extreme highs that may produce symptoms.  - Pt discharged on reduced lantus dose without sliding scale. . * Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid . * Hyperlipdemia - Hold statin and Tricor . * Ostomy Retraction - Ostomy is retracted as per ostomy nurse and surgery consult. Now with resuming stool output. KUB showed some stool c/w constipation. She was treated with Miralax with some improvement in her stool output.  She was recommened to continue to take stool softeners and  Miralax and to stay well hydrated to prevent constipation in the future.  She may also use milk of magnesia as well as needed. . PPX: Pt is at high risk for DVT given ovarian cancer. Pt will be discharged on daily dosing of lovenox to prevent DVT for palliative benefit [**Date Range **]: home today with hospice.  She is DNR/DNI.  Her oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will be the contact person for the Hospice agency.

History was obtained from family and the medical record.  Two days prior to admission, pt began experiencing sharp RUQ pain, nausea, nonbloody, nonbilious vomitus and diarrhea. The family denies any fevers, cough or chills and states she was in her normal state of health prior to developing pain. She did not want to go see her MD, but one day prior to transfer her pain worsened and she finally went to [**Hospital6 **].  At LGH intital labs were notable for a lipase of 2254 which trended upward to 8117, normal Cr and WBC of 22. Initial BUN was 22 but subsequently trended upward to 30. RUQ US revealed common bile duct dilitation and an abnormal appearance of her pancreas. She was given metronidazole and levofloxacin and admitted to the general medical floor where she was kept NPO and given IVF. CT scan of her abdomen and pelvis was performed and was concerning for necrosis, therefore were was transferred to the ICU where aggressive fluid repletion was initiated (at the time of transfer she has recieved 7 L. HCT demonstrated hemoconcentration (54) which remained stable despite fluids. Antitbiotics were broadened to imipenem. She remained hemodynamically stable, afebrile, with UOP of 60 cc/hr overnight.  Initial plan was for ERCP however the afternoon of transfer the patient developed an acute desaturation event to 88% on 5L NC. Saturations improved to 96% with 50% FiO2 via a venti mask. ABG at that time was 7.17/46.2/81.7 bicarb of 17. She was intubated prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. On transport she was noted to be transiently hypotensive to the 80s requiring peripheral levophed which was weaned off on arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. No ROS was obtained due to the patient being unconcious.  Of note [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] records the patient has a history of chronic nausea and intolerance of greasy food, however the family denies any previous diagnosis of gallbladder disease.

On arrival to the MICU on [**2141-6-14**], patient's VS 157/79 105 18 95% on CMV with RR 16, Vt 400, FiO2 60%. The patient was intubated and sedated due to ARDS. LIJ central venous catheter was placed given access issues. She was extubated on [**2141-6-20**] and was transfered to the medicine floor and was treated for VAP from [**Date range (3) 112125**] with zosyn and vancomycin (cipro was started initially, but subsequently discontinued). On [**2141-6-23**], she was transfered back to the ICU, re-intubated for hypoxia thought to be due to atelectasis, bilateral pleural effusions and a questionable infarct in the [**Date Range **] without thrombus, which was not anticoagulated. On [**2141-6-24**], she was noted to have ARF with rare eos (AIN), which was thought to be due to medications/contrast dye exposure. Several potential offending agents were discontinued. On ECHO on [**6-26**] was wnl. Her initial tachycardia later improved with verapamil. A LUQ u/s showed no gallstones and minimal sludge.

Distended gallbladder with sludge and possibly stones, though no ductal dilatation is seen.  3.  Patent portal venous system, though the splenic artery is attenuated.  RUQ U/S [**2141-6-15**] IMPRESSION: 1.  Gallbladder filled with sludge and gallstones.  No evidence of choledocholithiasis or definite cholecystitis at this time. 2.  Rounded heterogeneous segment II liver lesion without correlation to CT two days prior.  This could be focal fatty sparing but other lesions such as FNH could be missed on CT in equilibrium phase.  When the patient's condition improves, a repeat ultrasound should be obtained. 3.  Echogenic liver is most consistent with fatty deposition. More advanced liver disease such as fibrosis or cirrhosis can not be excluded on this study.  CT abdomen and pelvis [**2141-6-18**] IMPRESSION: 1. Redemonstration of necrotizing pancreatitis with unchanged distribution of pancreatic necrosis. Interval increase in peripancreatic fluid around on the tail of the pancreas and gastric greater curvature, but fluid collections do not appear organized. 2. Moderate nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.  Echo [**2141-6-26**] The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Doppler parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.  LENIs [**6-26**] The visualized vessels are patent and compressible with normal flow and augmentation. No thrombus is identified. There is normal phasicity within the common femoral veins bilaterally. IMPRESSION: No evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT.  [**2141-6-27**]: renal US: IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis.  CT chest from [**6-25**] Pulmonary nodules measuring up to 7 mm, for which a followup CT in three to six months is recommended if the patient is high risk for malignancy and 6 to 12 months if low risk for malignancy based on [**Last Name (un) 8773**] study guidance.   Brief Hospital Course: #. Severe, necrotizing gallstone pancreatitis: Resolved. Most likely gallstone pancreatitis though LFT pattern not c/w prolonged obstruction. Imaging at outside hospital demonstrated the presence of stones in addition to common bile duct dilitation. She was initially treated with meropenem  which was discontinued after several days. Surgery and ERCP services were consulted and suggested supportive medical management of pancreatitis. ERCP was deferred during acute disease state given that no obstructing stones were identified on CT and RUQ U/S. After acute disease state resolves, she will require lap cholecystectomy or ERCP with sphincterotomy (in 2-3months).  #. Hypoxemic/hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Resolved. Initial episode of respiratory failure was thought to be due to ARDS, as well as bilateral effusions and some vascular congestion, suggesting volume overload in the setting of aggressive volume resuscitation. After pt's pancreatitis started to improve, she was aggressively diuresed and weaned off of sedation and the ventilator. She did not have a cuff [**Last Name (LF) 3564**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was given steroids for 24hrs and was ultimately extubated.  After extubation, pt was called out to general medical floor on [**6-23**]. Within 24hrs, she developed worsening mental status and increased work of breathing. She was found to be hypercarbic on ABG. Despite aggressive diuresis and a trial of bipap, pt's CO2 did not improve, so she was re-intubated in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. After intubation, a bronchoscopy was performed that did not reveal any evidence of lobar infiltrate consistent with aspiration or pna. BAL cx was negative. A CTA was performed that revealed relative [**Name (NI) 20534**] of [**Name (NI) **] consistent with ischemic changes, but no thrombus was identified. LENIs were performed and did not demonstrate any evidence of clot and echo did not show right heart strain. She was also noted to have persistent bilateral pleural effusions. Due to the fact that no definitive clot was found and she clinically improved, a decision was made to not anticoagulate. She was extubated on [**2141-6-28**], and approximately 15min after, she developed stridor and increased wob. She was treated with steroids, racemic epinephrine and heliox for presumed laryngeal edema. After several hours her respiratory status improved and within 24 hrs she was weaned to nasal cannula. Chest X-ray showed improvement in bilateral effusion despite persistent ataelectasis. On discharge she was comfortable at rest and with ambulation on room air.  #. Ventilator associated pneumonia: On [**2141-6-20**], she developed worsening fevers and increased sputum production. Other sources of infection were investigated (normal U/A, abdomen imaging unchanged, no diarrhea), so she was empirically treated for VAP with vancomycin, zosyn and ciprofloxicin. Pt completed a 8 day treatment course for VAP. No current evidence of infectious process  #. Acute renal failure: Thought to be AIN after being exposed to cipro and zosyn, both of which can cause AIN. Renal U/S was performed and did not reveal any signs of hydronephrosis. Pt's cr continued to improve (last 1.2) and she continued to have good urine output.  #. Tachycardia: Improved with treatment of acute disease and with restarting her home verapamil and metoprolol (PCP confirmed that both are for hypertension).  #. Insomnia/delerium: Was previously on olanzapine for steroid vs. ICU induced delerium. She responded well however complained of increased insomnia. Olanzapine was discontinued and Trazodone was ordered.  #. Diabetes: She has had fluctuating blood sugars. Initial hyperglycemia treated with SSI and lantus resulted in next day hypoglycemia. Resolution of hypoglycemia achieved with D5W and holding insulin. Hyperglycemic again on [**2141-7-2**] with glucose in 400s. She was continued on gentle HISS while NPO. She was ultimately transition back to glargine and HISS. The diabetes service saw the patient and also adjusted her insulin dosing.  #. Hypertension, benign: Held home amlodpine, lisinopril and verapamil initially on admission. She was restarted on verapamil and metoprolol.  #. Peripheral Vascular Disease: - Continue home dose of ASA  # Anemia: Hct on admission in the 40's, now 23. Improved from yesterday. Iron studies c/w anemia of CD with ferritin of 859. Normocytic. LDH is elevated, but bili is normal and coags are normal so hemolysis and DIC seem less likely causes. -consider transfusion if hct <21  # Leukocytosis, thrombocytosis: Peaked on [**6-30**].

Gross:  The specimen is received fresh labeled with the patient's name, ""[**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname **]"", the medical record number and ""ileum."" It consists of a segment of small bowel measuring 92 cm in length and 3 cm in average diameter.  A portion of mesentery is attached to the small bowel that measures 2 x 4 x 3 cm. The specimen is not oriented.  The mesentery is unremarkable. The serosa of the bowel is focally erythematous and dusky looking. There are two staples measuring 3.7 and 5.2 cm.  The specimen is opened along the antimesenteric surface to reveal fecal material and blood within the lumen. The mucosa in the central portion of the bowel measuring 34 cm in length is erythematous, brown and dusky looking. No masses or polyps are identified.  No perforation site is identified.  The bowel wall within the affected area measures up to 0.2 cm in thickness.  Normal looking bowel measures up to 0.4 cm in thickness.  The specimen is represented in cassettes as follows:  A = 5.2 cm stapled margin, B = 3.7 cm staple margin, C = section of affected bowel, D = transition between effected and normal bowel, E-G = fat.  Brief Hospital Course: The patient with multiple medical problems was admitted to the General Surgical Service on [**2178-12-17**] for evaluation of an acute abdomen likely from ischemic bowel.  He was admitted to the SICU. He was made NPO, started on IV fluids, a foley catheter and CVL were placed, empiric IV Vancomycin and Zosyn were started, and he was given Fentanyl IV PRN for pain and Valium for sedation. He was emergently brought to the Operating Room, where he underwent exploratory laparotomy, reduction of internal volvulus of the small bowel, and small-bowel resection with primary anastomosis(reader referred to the Operative Note for details). He was found to have ischemic bowel with obstruction, peritonitis, and an internal volvulus of the small bowel. He was returned to the SICU for post-operative care. .

Please resume all regular home medications , unless specifically advised not to take a particular medication.  Also, please take any new medications as prescribed.  Please get plenty of rest, continue to ambulate several times per day, and drink adequate amounts of fluids.  Avoid lifting weights greater than [**5-3**] lbs until you follow-up with your surgeon, who will instruct you further regarding activity restrictions.  Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery while taking pain medications.  Please follow-up with your surgeon and Primary Care Provider (PCP) as advised.  Incision Care:  *Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner if you have increased pain, swelling, redness, or drainage from the incision site. *Avoid swimming and baths until your follow-up appointment. *You may shower, and wash surgical incisions with a mild soap and warm water.  Gently pat the area dry. *If you have steri-strips, they will fall off on their own. Please remove any remaining strips 7-10 days after surgery. *The lower incision wound will be cared for by your nurse. Car is a wet-to-dry dressing changed twice daily. . Coumadin (Warfarin):  What is this medicine used for? This medicine is used to thin the blood so that clots will not form.  How does it work? Warfarin changes the body's clotting system. It thins the blood to prevent clots from forming.  What you should contact your healthcare provider [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: Signs of a life-threatening reaction. These include wheezing; chest tightness; fever; itching; bad cough; blue skin color; fits; or swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat, severe dizziness or passing out, falls or accidents, especially if you hit your head. Talk with healthcare provider even if you feel fine, significant change in thinking clearly and logically, severe headache, severe back pain, severe belly pain, black, tarry, or bloody stools, blood in the urine, nosebleeds, coughing up blood, vomiting blood, unusual bruising or bleeding, severe menstrual bleedin, or rash.  Call your doctor if you are unable to eat for several days, for whatever reason. Also call if you have stomach problems, vomiting, or diarrhea that lasts more than 1 day. These problems could affect your Coumadin??????/warfarin dosage.  Coumadin (Warfarin) and diet: Certain foods and beverages can impair the effect of warfarin. For this reason, it's important to pay attention to what you eat while taking this medication.  Until recently, doctors advised [**Name5 (PTitle) **] taking warfarin to avoid foods high in vitamin K. This is because large amounts of vitamin K can counteract the benefits of warfarin. However, recent research shows that rather than eliminating vitamin K from your diet, it is more important to be consistent in your dietary vitamin K intake.  These foods contain vitamin K: Fruits and vegetables, such as: Kiwi, Blueberries, Broccoli, Cabbage, [**Location (un) 2831**] sprouts, Green onions, Asparagus, Cauliflower, Peas, Lettuce, Spinach, Turnip, collard, and mustard greens, Parsley, Kale, Endive. Meats, such as: Beef liver, Pork liver. Other: Mayonnaise, Margarine, Canola oil, Soybean oil, Vitamins, Soybeans and Cashews.  Limit alcohol. Alcohol can affect your Coumadin??????/warfarin dosage but it does not mean you must avoid all alcohol. Serious problems can occur with alcohol and Coumadin??????/warfarin when you drink more than 2 drinks a day or when you change your usual pattern. Binge drinking is not good for you. Be careful on special occasions or holidays, and drink only what you usually would on any regular day of the week.  Monitoring: The doctor decides how much Coumadin??????/warfarin you need by testing your blood. The test measures how fast your blood is clotting and lets the doctor know if your dosage should change. If your blood test is too high, you might be at risk for bleeding problems. If it is too low, you might be at risk for forming clots. Your doctor has decided on a range on the blood test that is right for you. The blood test used for monitoring is called an INR.  Use of Other medications: When Coumadin??????/warfarin is taken with other medicines it can change the way other medicines work. Other medicines can also change the way Coumadin??????/warfarin works. It is very important to talk with your doctor about all of the other medicines that you are taking, including over-the-counter medicines, antibiotics, vitamins, or herbal products.

He was diagnosed in [**Month (only) 1096**] with GBM (by biopsy) in the setting of increasing confusion, memory loss.  He was started in [**Month (only) 1096**] on high dose radiation therapy at which time he was also started on high dose decadron w/ q3day taper (most recently on 3mg); last radiation session was late [**Month (only) 1096**].  He also recently had a port placed through which he was receiving avastin (last 2 weeks ago).  His family reports mildly productive cough (cold sx) beginning approximately 1 week ago; he had a CXR 3-4 days ago which reportedly was negative for pneumonia and took atovaquone. . After the onset of these pulmonary symptoms, he later developed left knee ""bursitis"" last week for which he received injection most recently yesterday by PCP (presumably steroid injection). He had largely been bed bound over the last few days [**1-4**] to left knee pain.  Beginning this morning, he was very exhausted.  He took a nap this morning and when he awoke, he was confused, somnolent, lethargic.  His wife called EMS and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  En route to the ED, he was noted to be in a.fib with RVR for which he received diltiazem. . In the ED initial vitals were T 96.7 HR 112 BP 105/67 RR 28  O2 sat 85% RA.  CXR showed multifocal PNA at RUL, RLL, LLL.  He was placed on NRB and shortly thereafter O2 sats again dropped to the 80s, thus he was intubated 4:30 pm.  Blood cultures were drawn and he received levofloxacin 750g IV x1, vancomycin 1g IV x1, ceftriaxone 1g IV x1, and azithromycin 500mg x1.  He also received 10mg IV decadron.  He was initially normotensive, but dropped pressure at 6:30 pm into 70s requiring initiation of phenylephrine gtt.  Over his entire ED course, received total 5L NS. . Head CT demonstrated ""no new findings"" and was reportedly reviewed by [**Hospital1 18**] neurosurgery however there is no note in chart/OMR.  Additionally he was seen by his neurologist who follows him at [**Hospital1 2025**], however there is no documentation of this.

He was on the medical floor for 16 hours prior to discharge and was stable during this time. . # Septic Shock:  Met criteria for septic shock.  On presentation had clear pulmonary source of infection.  Initial sputums grew out pneumococci.  Patient relatively immunocompromised due both to cancer diagnosis and chronic steroid use secondary to brain tumor. On admission patient had central line placed, CVPs maintained [**7-15**].  Patient needed pressors to maintain BP initially.  On levophed, but developed some tachyarrhythmnias (Afib with RVR) so was switched to neo.  Initially covered with Zosyn, levoflox and vanco.  Patient was continued on atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 6187**].  Patient was also intubated on presentation, and maintained on AC.  Patient had EKGs without signs of ischemia, and  multiple sets of normal cardiac enzymes.  Pressors were largely weaned by HD #3.  He did rarely require brief periods of neosynepherine, due to too-rapid diuresis. The patient had a normal cortisol stim test. Historically, it was noted that the patient had a red left knee a few days prior to admission.  This knee was tapped by ortho and found to be floridly septic.  He was taken to the OR and washed out by Ortho (please see seperate op note for full accounting of this procedure).  This infection was found to be MSSA, which also grew out of his blood and eventually out of his R chest chemo-port, which was removed by surgery.  He was maintained on a 6week course of Nafcillin for this staph infection.  A TEE demonstrated no signs of endocarditis. Infectious disease was consulted and assisted with his antibiotic regimen. The patient completed a full 14d course of Levoflox for pneumonia.  The patient also had a full course of Clinda for a question of toxic shock syndrome or aspiration pneumonia.  His Vanco was d/c'd after 5d due to only MSSA growing out.  On [**12-20**] his pre-existing R chest chemo port was noted to be purulent and was removed by surgery.  This grew out MSSA.  Once more, the nafcillin was continued for 6week total course. A [**12-21**] culture grew out yeast and he was started on a course of fluconisol as per ID.  He recieved a full Ophtho eval which demonstrated no ocular involvment. Planned course of treatment is for nafcillin for total of 6 weeks to end [**1-30**], fluconazole for 2 weeks total to end [**1-9**], and ceftriaxone to end [**1-10**]. . # Afib c RvR:  New-onset afib in the face of sepsis, hypotension, infection.  Patient initially controlled with boluses of Diltiazem or Lopressor.  Often returned into Afib during times of increased activity or stress.  Used neosynepharine which seemed less arrhythmagenic.  Amiodarone was tried initially for control, but the patient became to bradycardic on this [**Doctor Last Name 360**].  As patient was weaned from pressors he was begun on a regimen of metoprolol which seemed to control his rate well.  He did ocassionally return to RVR, which was treated with boluses of dilt or lopressor with good effect. He was then restarted on amiodarone [**1-1**] and responded to it well. Due to his brain tumor he was note anticoagulated during his time in the ICU. The risks and benefits were discussed. It was felt that the risks of ICH outweighed the benefits of stroke prevention at this time. Plans were made to readdress this issue once the patient's mental status improved. . # Septic Arthritis:  As above, had septic arthritis of L knee treated via washout by ortho on [**12-17**].  Nafcillin x6weeks per ID started on [**12-19**]. Nafcillin is scheduled to finish on [**1-30**]. Patient did have a swollen L wrist later in his course, but this was tapped by Ortho and never grew out any bacteria. Plastics-hand was consulted and felt clinically that this was not a septic joint, instead just a manifestation of his chronic RA. Ortho also felt it was not prudent to washout his R knee, which was clinically asymptomatic during his ICU course. His L knee healed well and the staples and drain were removed without incidence.  He has been signed off from direct ortho care, and is weight-bearing as tolerated at time of ICU discharge. . #Respiratory status:  Patient was maintained on ARDS-style ventilation while on the ventilator.  He has a bronchoscopy on [**12-18**] which showed diffuse thick bloody sputum greatest in the R LL.  By [**12-19**] the patient was changed to pressure support ventilation.  The patient was activily diuresed at this time, with good effect and improving respiratory status.  The patient tested negative for legionella and influenza.  The patient was quickly weaned to CPAP+PS of [**4-7**], but was difficult to wean fully from the vent due mainly to his mental status.   He was extubated on [**12-24**] with great success. On [**12-25**] the patient was noted to have an increasing o2 requirement and a CXR demonstrated a moderate-sized R pneumothorax.  Thoracic surgery was consulted and placed a chest tube.  This tube was intermittantly to wall-suction, water-seal or clamped.  On [**1-2**] it was d/c'd, with the pneumothoax smaller in size. . #GBM:  Head CTs compared to his baseline [**Hospital1 2025**] scans showed no interval change.  He was maintained on his baseline 3mg of Dexamethasone while inpatient here. It appears that neurooncs original plans were to taper the dexamethasone. We were unable to contact primary neuro-oncoligist to discuss steroid taper but this should be discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] when he becomes available. . #Anemia/thrombocytopenia:  Had anemia of chronic disease, admitted with thrombocytopenia attributed to Avastin and timador.  His thrombocytopenia was asymptomatic during his hospital course, and steadily improved.  His anemia was mild, and did require occasional transfusion. . # Hyperglycemia:  Intitally hyperglycemic in face of sepsis, controlled with SS insulin and resolved on its own. . #R Chest wound:  Con't to drain purulent material s/p removal of port.  Surgery recommended QID dilute([**12-6**]) Dakin's solution and close f/u.  Any fluctuant areas must be debrided. . #Mental Status:  The patient presented with altered mental status felt to be due to sepsis.  He did take some days to awaken from his intubated and sedated state.  He continued to be Aox1-2 in the MICU, with symptoms consistent with delerium. A repeat head CT showed no change; his delerium was felt to be mainly post-septic and ICU related and appeared to be slowly intervally improving each day. . #Prophylaxis: Patient was initially on pneumoboots and then Heparin SC, a bowel regmimen and a Gi prophlyaxsis throughout his hospital course. . # Electrolytes:  The patient required extensive repletion of his potassium during his ICU course, often requiring q6hr lyte checks and 100-200meq of K+ per day.  This was felt to be mostly due to a diarrhea and thus GI loss, and was resolving at the end of his hospital course as diarrhea resolved. . # Nutrition:  The patient was maintained on TF while intubated, and also s/p intubation as he failed his initial speech and swallow exams. On [**1-3**] he passed his speech and swallow bedside test. . #LFTs:  Patient had elevated LFTs on presentation which were attributed to sepsis.  This abnormality resolved as the patient's clinical picture improved.  He should continue on weekly LFT checks due to his continuing nafcillin. . # PT/OT:  after extubation the patient was followed actively by PT and OT.   Medications on Admission: # Naproxen prn # Mepron (prophylaxis) # Hydrocodone # Dexamethasone 3mg # Avastin (last received 2wks ago, due on Monday [**2154-12-16**]) # Lipid lowering [**Doctor Last Name 360**] (wife unsure of name) # Timador (was previously on this, but was stopped [**1-4**] to thrombocytopenia)  Discharge Medications: 1.

On initial evaluation, patient was found to have 3mm opening of distal trachea secondary to external compression from mediastinal mass, RUL mass, RUL collapse, and clinical findings consistent with SVC sydrome. Y-stent was placed that evening, in addition to Pigtail catheter for right-sided effusion. Patient remained intubated following surgery, on paralytics due to low-lying ET tube and small volume bleeding after endobronchial biopsy. On [**2172-8-26**], extubated was attempted. Patient was reintubated within 10 minutes due to neurological unresponsiveness, hypoxia (O2 saturation 80s), and hemodynamic instability. She was found to have a right pneumothorax, which improved with subsequent placement of chest tube. Patient was also noted to have pericardial effusion; given absence of physiologic tamponade, cardiology decided against pericardiocentesis. . Hospital course also complicated by hyponatremia on admission (Na 118) attributed to SIADH and improved with fluid restriction (Na 126). Also with hypotension (sBP 90s) following reintubation on [**2172-8-26**]. Given hyperkalemia, hyponatremia adrenal insufficiency was suspected; evaluated by endocrine team who recommended stress dose steroids pending further evaluation of etiology of hypotension. Also with non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, transient hypothermia (T 95 [**2172-8-26**]) of unknown etiology. . Per report, patient has done well today. She remains intubated, on pressure support. Given the above pathology results, patient is transferred to the medical ICU ([**Hospital Ward Name 332**]) for radiation therapy. . On arrival to the [**Hospital 332**] medical ICU, patient is intubated, sedated, and unable to provide history.  Past Medical History: Hypertension s/p cerebral sneurysm repair x3 GERD   Social History: Per review of records, 60 pack-year history  Family History: Unable to obtain.

Imaging: [**8-25**] CT Chest without contrast: 1. Large mediastinal mass causes narrowing of the right pulmonary artery, superior vena cava, and trachea and occlusion of the pulmonary artery supplying the right upper lobe in addition to the right upper lobe bronchus. These findings are most concerning for a primary lung carcinoma. 2. Right upper lobe collapse with nonenhancing lung parenchyma. Tumor involvement cannot be excluded. Atelectasis of the right lower and middle lobe. 3. Large right pleural effusion. . [**8-25**] Tracheal mass tissue pathology: Immunohistochemical studies show that tumor cells are positively stained by TTF-1 and CK7; they are negative for CK20, chromogranin, and synaptophysin.  The tumor shows areas of necrosis, extensive apoptosis and focal lymphatic vascular invasion; some areas  the tumor cell size approaching that of a small cell carcinoma, but much of the tumor has larger nuclei. Overall, the tumor probably fits into the spectrum of a small cell carcinoma of lung. . [**8-26**] Pleural fluid cytology: Rare groups of epithelioid cells, too few to characterize further. By immunohistochemistry: mesothelial cells stain for calretinin and WT-1. Epithelial markers [**Last Name (un) **]-31, CEA, and B72.3 are negative. Rare cells are highlighted by TTF-1; however, these cells are not cytologically atypical and may represent non-specific reactivity. . [**8-26**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Low QRS voltage in limb leads. No previous tracing available for comparison. . [**8-26**] Echo: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a small to moderate sized, primarily anterior pericardial effusion without right ventricular diastolic collapse. IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild-moderate, primarily anterior pericardial effusion. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. If clinically indicated, a follow-up study is suggested. . [**8-27**] CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with and without contrast: 1. Vascular findings unchanged from [**2172-8-25**]. Narrowing of SVC and left brachiocephalic vein by large mediastinal mass. The SVC is narrowed to approximately 5 mm over a region extending 3 cm in craniocaudal dimension. Indirect evidence of right brachiocephalic vein occlusion, likely complete. Unchanged narrowing of right pulmonary artery. Splayed but patent aortic arch branches. 2. Interval decrease in large right pleural effusion, with small anterior pneumothorax. Right chest tube terminating at apex. 3. No interval change in large infiltrative hypoattenuating right hilar/mediastinal mass. 4. No evidence of metastases in the abdomen or pelvis. Slightly bulky left adrenal gland without discrete nodule or mass. 5. Anasarca and small amount of peritoneal fluid collecting in the pelvis, likely related to edema. 6. Interval tracheal stenting with improved caliber of airway. . [**2172-8-27**] ECHO: Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2172-8-26**], the size of the pericardial effusion is unchanged with no signs of tamponade. The left ventricle seems to be underfilled. . [**8-28**] CT Head: 1. Within limits of this modality, no evidence of enhancing mass or edema to suggest metastatic disease. 2. Status post bilateral frontal craniotomy and probable aneurysm clipping with encephalomalacic changes in the right frontotemporal and left temporal lobes. No evidence of acute hemorrhage or infarct.  3. Probable chronic bifrontal subdural hygromas with minimal mass effect on the subjacent frontal gyri; these may relate to the extensive remote surgery . [**2172-9-2**] CT Head (performed due to worsened mental status): 1. Unchanged examination from recent exam of [**2172-8-28**]. 2. Status post bilateral frontal craniotomies with aneurysm clipping and encephalomalcia, as described above. No evidence of acute hemorrhage or infarct. . [**2172-9-3**] Renal US: 1. Mildly echogenic kidneys consistent with medical renal disease. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, stone, or mass. 2. The left kidney remains atrophic and lobulated, similar to [**2172-8-27**]. . [**2172-9-4**] CT Chest w/o contrast (to evaluate tumor s/p XRT and chemo for future XRT sessions): 1. Right anterior pneumothorax has resolved. 2. Mixed response of the tumor to radiotherapy with a decrease of the central component of the tumor and a mixed response of the peripheral tumor components: 3. The peripheral consolidations in the right upper lobe have overall decreased in size, however, a new cavitary lesion has formed measuring 11 x 19 mm. 4. The peripheral consolidations in the right lower lobe and left lower lobe have increased in size, number and density and may be part of post- obstructive, post-radiotherapy, post-infectious, or acute inflammatory changes. 5. Lymphangio-carcinomatosis in the right upper lobe. 6. There is new small right pleural effusion and increased moderate left pleural effusion. 7. Left adrenal gland mass is only partially visualized in this study. . [**2172-9-3**] EEG: Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the very disorganized and slow background rhythms. This suggests a widespread and moderately severe encephalopathy in both cortical and subcortical structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes. Although there were fleeting asymmetries, there was no reliable area of focal slowing. Encephalopathies may obscure focal findings. There are some sharp features, but no clearly epileptiform abnormalities and no electrographic seizures. . [**2172-9-5**] LENI: no DVT . [**2172-9-5**] ECHO: final read pending . Micro: [**2172-8-26**] Pleural fluid: GRAM STAIN (Final [**2172-8-26**]): 3+  (5-10 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES. NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.

Bronchoscopy [**2172-9-4**]: lots of necrotic tissue noted, ETT tube dislodged between stent and tracheal wall, repositioned during bronch.  Brief Hospital Course: [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course [**Date range (3) 84902**] 58F with likely small cell carcinoma complicated by SVC syndrome, airway compromise requiring Y-stent, pericardial effusion, resolved pleural effusion and pneumothorax, and electrolytes disturbances admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for radiation decompression therapy and chemotherapy. Pt developed respiratory failure and renal failure. . #. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt was initially transferred from SICU to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on CPAP/PS. She developed increasing respiratory failure and was changed to AC mode.  In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she underwent XRT x2 and then chemotherapy for 3 days. Increased hypoxia may have been due to pneumothorax, which resolved, pleural effusions, atelectasis, possible VAP, tumor compression. During hypoxic episodes, pt underwent bronchoscopy twice, both times of which demonstrated the ETT lodged between tracheal wall and stent. Pt's saturation improved with repositioning. Respiratory status also complicated by possible underlying COPD given smoking history with possible air stacking/trapping. Pt was started on vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin (started [**2172-8-31**] for 8 day course) for VAP. Vanco was later held as the level was elevated in the setting of renal failure.  Patient's family decided to persue comfort only care on [**2172-9-6**], and she was terminally extubated.  Patient expired 15 minutes later from respiratory failure and asystole secondary to lung cancer. . # Altered Mental Status: Pt had decline in mental status over time. She initially withdrew from noxious stimuli but later was less responsive. AMS continued despite sedation being off. AMS most likely due to toxic metabolic syndrome in setting of uremia and multi-system organ failure. Differential also included seizure (given hx of cerebral aneurysm repair, on anti-epileptics presumably prophylactically) although EEG did not demonstrate focal abnormalities. LP did not demonstrate infection or spread of malignancy. CT head [**2172-9-2**] negative for acute process. . #. Small cell lung carcinoma: per pathology, the tumor probably fits into the spectrum of a small cell carcinoma of lung. Given associated SVC syndrome, prognosis poor. CT head/[**Last Name (un) 103**]/pelvis negative for metastases.  Pt underwent 3 days of chemotherapy and 2 sessions of XRT.  Initially, XRT was clinical emergency - normal and pathologic tissue was likely treated; necrotic tissue noted on bronchoscopy [**2172-9-4**]. Pt was to undergo formal tissue planning session on [**2172-9-8**] to better delineate area of radiation however family decided to persue comfort only care on [**2172-9-6**]. . # Acute Renal failure: In setting of chemo with carboplatin. Urine casts consistent with ATN. Uric acid and electrolytes elevated 4-5d post chemotherapy concerning for tumor lysis syndrome.  The next therapeutic step was dialysis as patient became oliguric despite volume overload but the family wished for comfort only care given dismal prognosis of her lung cancer. . #. Metabolic acidosis: Originally thought to be non-gap metabolic acidosis due to hypoaldosteronism and type IV RTA. With low albumin, however, this is a gap metabolic acidosis, most likely due to uremia. Unable to increase RR to compensate due to concern for auto-peeping in setting of possible COPD. Goal pH is 7.3-7.35. On [**2172-9-5**], pt's acidosis worsened with pH 7.16-7.18. Despite adjusting ETT placement and decreasing RR to reduce auto-peep, pt's acidosis worsened. Bicarbonate was given.  . # Tachycardia/Hypotension ?????? Pt with tachycardia to 140s and episodes of hypotension to SBP low 80s. Pt with new A-fib on telemetry and EKG. DDx includes possible enlarging pericardial effusion/tamponade but pulsus paradoxus was normal and ECHO [**2172-9-5**] was unchanged from prior. No pneumothorax seen on CXR. Unable to assess for PE by CTA as pt in renal failure and VQ would not be helpful in setting of other lung pathology. LENI's negative for DVT. PE likely given malignancy and prolonged bed rest but unable to do CTA given renal failure and VQ scan not helpful in setting of lung changes. Even if it had been positive, heme/onc recommended against anti-coagulation in setting of possible tumor necrosis/hemorrhage. Pt remained tachycardic to 130s despite numerous fluid boluses. . #. Electrolyte disturbances: Pt developed hypernatremia on [**2172-9-4**] most likley due to dehydration with free water deficit of 1.4L, started on D5W. Pt had hyponatremia and hyperkalemia on admission, both resolved. Unclear etiology of electrolyte disturbances on admission- hyponatremia thought to be secondary to possible adrenal insufficency (now discarded) or possibly SIADH.  Low UNa does not exclude SIADH; renal recommended rechecking urine lytes with saline load, whcih was not done in setting of pt??????s other medical issues. Hyperkalemia originally attributed to hypoaldosteronism and Type IV RTA, but unlikely per endocrine because of low urine sodium. . #. SVC syndrome:  Incomplete occlusion of SVC; near complete occlusion of brachiocephalic veins. Clinically identified by upper extremity and facial swelling/plethora and mottled skin. Also with scleral edema. Unable to assess jugular venous distension given considerable swelling. Seen in appoximately 10% cases of SSLC. Improved edema on exam compared to admission. SVC syndrome occurred after Y-stent placed. Possible that tumor pushing into trachea shifted to compress SVC after stent placement. She underwent radiation therapy and chemotherapy for decompression. . #. Pleural effusion:  s/p right pigtail catheter placement [**2172-8-25**], removed [**2172-8-31**]. LDH effusion/serum 0.68 (exudate by Light??????s criteria). Greatest concern for malignant effusion however cytology was nonspecific.  Cultures of fluid all preliminary negative. . #. Pneumothorax: Developed pneumothorax in setting of re-intubation that resolved after chest tube placement. . #. Pericardial effusion:  Suspected by cardiology to be malignant effusion. Felt not to be large enough for percutaneous drainage. EKG without signs of electrical alternans but does have low voltages. Repeat ECHO done [**2172-9-5**] in setting of hypotension demonstrated no change in pericardial effusion. . # Sinus Pause on telemetry: Pt had episodes of sinus pauses on tele night of [**8-30**] with turning to right side. Occurred again [**2172-9-4**] again with re-positioning. Metoprolol was held and glucagon given in case this was due to beta blocker toxicity, but pauses decreased in frequency and duration on their own without intervention. Cardiology consulted who felt it was vagally mediated. [**Month (only) 116**] have been due to ETT tube displacement pressing on carotid when pt was turned. . # Leukopenia/thrombocytopenia ?????? Most likely due to chemotherapy and no improvement in counts on neupogen. She was repeatedly pan-cultured with negative results. . #. Anemia:  Normocytic and likely due to anemia of chronic disease given malignancy.  Hemolysis labs were negative. . # s/p cerebral aneurysm repair:  History of cerebral aneurysm repair with a number of chronic changes on head CT.  Her antiepileptic medications were continued.

ERCP   History of Present Illness: 47 YO Caucasian male with Hx of chronic pancreatitis admitted following an anaphylactoid reaction in CT scan.  Today, the patient went for ERCP to further evaluate his pancreatitis.  The ventral pancreatic duct was normal in caliber.  The pancreastic duct in the area of the head of the pancreas was very dilated, and contained multiple stones.  There was no filling of the pancreatic duct beyond the head.  There were no lesions amenable to endoscopic therapy. The patient went for a CTA pancreas to rule out pancreatic neoplasm b/c of elevated CEA and CA19-9.  The patient received IV contrast and developed flushing, periorbital/facial edema and hives.  Code Blue was called and the patient was given IV benadryl, solumedrol, and H2 blocker.  The patient maintained his O2 sats >100% on a 100% NRB, and BP had MAP>60.  The patient was able to speak without difficulty and was x-ferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitoring.

There is no pleural effusion. The liver and spleen are not enlarged. Ther is mild intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. The CBD measures up to 10 mm. The gallbladder, kidneys, and both adrenals are unremarkable. There are multiple coarse calcifications throughout the head and body of the pancreas. Mild dilatation of the pancreatic main duct. In the head of the pancreas, there is a septated cystic region measuring 12 x 15 mm that could correspond with dilated side branches of the duct, or IPMT. This region doesn't enhance following the administration of the IV contrast. The pancreas appears irregular. There is no free fluid or free air within the abdomen. The aorta is normal in caliber. The bowel loops appear unremarkable.  ERCP: 1. The distal pancreatic duct within the head and neck of the pancreas is markedly dilated with multiple filling defects consistent with stones. The pancreatic duct proximally within the body and tail of the pancreas cannot be opacified. 2. Normal-appearing ventral pancreatic duct.   Brief Hospital Course: 1. Anaphylaxis:  the pt had anaphylactoid reaction to IV contrast dye during CT as evidenced by acute onset of flushing, periorbital/facial edema, and hives.  He was treated in the CT suite with IV benadryl, and was observed to maintain O2 sat 100% on NRB and had MAP>60 at all times.  He was admitted to the ICU for ongoing care, and was treated with standing doses of IV benadryl, famotidine, and solumedrol overnight.  The pt had stable respiratory status and BP throughout his admission.  By HD#2, his facial edema and hives had resolved, and he was transferred to the medical [**Hospital1 **] for ongoing care.  On the medical [**Hospital1 **], he was asymptomatic and tolerated regular diet for lunch well.  After lunch, he was d/c home with instructions to take benadryl prn for itching or rash.  The pt was instructed to present to the ED if he developed repeated hives, dyspnea, weakness, or confusion. . 2. Chronic pancreatitis:   his pacreatitis has been long-standing, with evidence of pancreatic calcification on CT and ERCP consistent with pancreatic ductal stones.  These stones were not amenable to removal by ERCP, and as they are contributing to inflammation and pain, the pt was referred for consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] for surgical treatment.  During his admission, he was treated with pancreatic enzyme replacement before meals.  His pain was controlled with IV dilaudid initially, and on the day of d/c the pt was transition to his usual regimen of oral morphine, with good results.

Briefly, 47 y/o man with long standing history of epilepsy s/p right temporal lobectomy (at age 19) and VNS placement (7 years ago), h/o EtOH and cocaine abuse who was having increased seizure frequency in the setting of VNS malfunction. He was admitted on [**1-28**] for elective replacement of the vagus nerve stimulator generator.  The procedure went without complication. Overnight he developed AF with RVR to the 180s with hypotension to the 80s.  CIWA was 17 with last drink approximately 72 hours prior. Patient was also noted to be [**Doctor Last Name **] with a CIWA of 17 and is thought that last EtOH drink was 72 hours ago.  He received 2mg IV ativan with somnolence and apenea afterwards. He was subsequently transferred to the MICU. . His MICU course was notable for an echocardiogram which showed a large pericardial effusion on [**1-29**].  He was seen by the cardiology fellow and subsequently underwent pericardial window. 450cc of bloody pericardial fluid was drained. Patient developed SVT in the cath lab and was treated with 9 mg IV metoprolol. He was transferred to CCU postprocedurally for monitoring. . On arrival, patient complained of spinal back pain from lying on the operating table. He also reports that his lungs feel ""collapsed"" but denied shortness of breath. .

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.  RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Increased IVC diameter (>2.1cm) with 35-50% decrease during respiration (estimated RA pressure (10-15mmHg).  LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size. Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Depressed LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.  RIGHT VENTRICLE: Borderline normal RV systolic function.  AORTIC VALVE: No AS.  MITRAL VALVE: No MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.  PERICARDIUM: Moderate to large pericardial effusion. No RA diastolic collapse. No RV diastolic collapse.  GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows. The rhythm appears to be atrial flutter. Echocardiographic patient.  Poor image quality.The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg with IVC dilation (2.5 cm). Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. LV systolic function appears mildly depressed. There is no ventricular septal defect. RV with borderline normal free wall function. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion (greatest anteriorly and best seen in the subcostal view). No right atrial diastolic collapse is seen. No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen (mild RV compression in the subcostal view is suggestive of elevated intrapericardial pressure). . Cardiac cath [**1-29**]: COMMENTS: Under fluoroscopic guidance, 450 CC of bloody pericardial fluid was obtained through subxiphoid approach. Intrapericardial origin of fluid was confirmed with contrast injection and intrapericardial pressure measurement. Initial pericardial pressure was elevated at 21 mm Hg and dropped to 3 mm Hg after remorval of fluid. Pericaridal drain was sutured in place for 24 hours.  FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Successful urgent pericardiocentesis through subxiphoid approach for impending pericardial temponade . ECHO [**2196-1-30**] IMPRESSION: Small amount of echodense pericardial material/fluid is seen. No evidence of tamponade. Probable regional LV systolic dysfunction. Moderately dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.  Compared with the prior studies (images reviewed) of [**2196-1-29**] and [**2194-7-23**], the appearance of the pericardium is similar to that of the post-tap echo yesterday. The basal to mid inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis was probably present in [**2194**] but image quality is poor on all studies. The right ventricle appears dilated on studies from yesterday and today - it was probably normal in [**2194**].  . LENI'S [**2196-2-1**] BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale, color, and Doppler images of the bilateral common femoral, superficial and deep femoral, and popliteal veins were obtained. There is non-occlusive thrombus in the mid left popliteal vein and left peroneal veins, as well as the right posterior tibial vein. The bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and right popliteal veins demonstrated normal compressibility and wall-to-wall color flow.  IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombus in left popliteal, left peroneal, and right posterior tibial veins. . CT TORSO [**2196-2-1**] (PRELIM) 1. Pulmonary embolism involving right lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] posterior basal segmental and subsegmental branches, and subsegmental branch of left lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] anterior basal pulmonary artery. 2. Bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. 3. Evidence of right heart strain, manifest as reflux of IV contrast into the IVC and hepatic veins. 4. Mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy with right hilar soft tissue causing some narrowing of the airways and vessels, concerning for malignancy.  Bronchial wall thickening noted, particularly along right middle [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] and right lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] bronchi. 5. Perifissural consolidation in posteromedial right middle [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] represent atelectasis or infection; however, underlying tumor or extension of right hilar mass not excluded. 6. 11 mm spiculated nodule in the right upper [**First Name3 (LF) 3630**] is suspicious for malignancy. 7. Predominantly paraseptal emphysema in the right upper [**First Name3 (LF) 3630**] with largest bulla measuring 3.5 x 5.9 cm. 8. Tiny pericardial fluid and possible pericardial thickening. 9. No evidence of malignancy in the abdomen and pelvis. 10. Intraabdominal findings include aortic and iliac artery calcifications, colonic diverticulosis, and tiny bubble of gas within the urinary bladder, which could be due to recent catheterization (correlate clinically). 11. No bony destruction concerning for malignancy. 12. Evidence of right femoral head avascular necrosis, without significant collapse. .  CT HEAD [**2-2**] No evidence of an acute intracranial process. Postoperative changes of right temporal lobectomy. . Pathology, pericardial effusion: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, Consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma.  Repeat echo, [**2-2**]: LV systolic function appears depressed. The right ventricular cavity is borderline dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.   Brief Hospital Course: 47 yo M with history of epilepsy admitted for elective vagal nerve stimulator replacement, transferred to MICU for management of tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxia, found to have pericardial effusion, now s/p pericardiocentiesis with drain in place, transferred to CCU for post-operative monitoring, with frequent agitation, now found to have bilateral PEs . # Pericardial effusion:  In the MICU, pt noted to be tachycardic with hypotension, and found to have pericardial effusion.  He underwent pericardiocentesis with drain placement with drainage of bloody fluid.  Hct stable despite profuse bloody drainage. Etiology is likely malignancy given that CT torso showing RUL lung spiculated nodule. Effusion cytology and micro showed cells c/w metastatic lung adenocarcinoma.  Drain was eventually pulled without complication and without any further hemodynamic instability.  Pulsus checked for several days after drain pulled and resolved effusion on Echo, was ~8 mmHg on discharge. . # PE/DVT:  Pt noted to have enlarged RV on repeat echo [**1-31**], so CTA was obtained for concern of PEs which confirmed b/l subsegmental PEs.  LENIs also positive for b/l DVTs.  He was started on heparin ggt in house and transitioned to an anticoagulation regimen of coumadin, with a lovenox bridge.  He will f/u with his PCP on [**Name9 (PRE) 2974**] [**2-12**] after discharge. . #  Agitation: Patient with history of EtOH, marijuana, cocaine/crack binges. He was significantly agitated throughout admission which was initially thought to be secondary to ETOH withdrawal.  He was maintained on a valium CIWA and klonipin 1mg TID.  However, agitation persisted despite being well out of the acute withdrawal window.  He had several code purples called for him and was often violent towards nurses. Of note, pt would be lucid and engaging often during the day with decompensation at night.  Psych was consulted who felt that this was less likely to be withdrawal and instead a behavioral issue/delerium, likely in setting of supratherapeutic valproate level.  They recommended haldol for his agitation which was continued 5mg PRN along with 10mg QHS standing, these were discontinued on discharge, takes no psych meds at home and delirium apparently cleared.  Evaluated by psychiatry prior to discharge, appeared to understand importance of f/u.  He was started on MVI, thiamine, folate. . # Afib with RVR: Patient oscillates between HR of 70s ?????? 170s with frequent episodes of RVR on tele, asymptomatic. Based on old records, has a history of Afib with RVR, a flutter, was treated with diltiazem and flecainide, and was supposed to be on Metoprolol.  Increased metoprolol to 75 mg po qid standing which has controlled rate well, though still with frequent episodes of rapid ventricular response that respond to IV lopressor 5 mg x 1.  Because of continued episodes of RVR (likely in the setting of pericardial effusion and multiple PEs) pt started on diltiazem drip, weaned off and started on diltiazem ER 120 mg daily, and metoprolol changed to 200 mg of metoprolol succinate on discharge.  HR in the 60s with these changes, with short bursts of SVT to 130s prior to discharge.  Would consider uptitrating rate control as an outpatient. . #. h/o epilepsy and seizure activity: VNS placed and was re-activated about 1 week after placement.  He was continued home AEDs.   Depakote ER 1250/1500/1500 and Oxcarbazepine 600 mg [**Hospital1 **] which was often given IV due to inability to take POs from agitation.  Depakote level was found to be elevated in setting of delirium, however unclear if this was true trough.  Was discharged on home meds and advised to f/u with his outpatient neurologist for management of his depakote. . # Foley self-d/c:  Pt pulled own foley overnight [**1-30**].  Of note there was blood around the uerethral meatus after he pulled it. Urine output was monitored and foley ended up being replaced on [**2-2**] given that he was put back into 4pt restraints.  Foley dc'ed and was able to void on his own with no hematuria for remaineder of admission.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Seizure disorder Atrial fibrillation Lung adenocarcinoma, pericardial effusion Deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.   Discharge Instructions: You were seen in the hospital to have your vagal nerve stimulator replaced, which has been turned on again, for your seizures.  You were also found to have a very fast heart rate from your atrial fibrillation (irregular heart rate) and for this we started diltiazem and metoprolol, which slow your heart rate.  In addition, you were found to have a pericardial effusion (fluid around your heart) which is likely due to spreading of lung cancer, which was discovered on a CT scan.  You were seen by the oncologists here who recommended that you go to clinic for follow up to discuss further workup and treatment.  You were also found to have a pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in your lung and legs) for which you were started a blood thinner.  You will be taking a blood thinner called Coumadin to prevent more clots from forming and to treat the ones you already have, and you should take this medication every day.  You will be taking Lovenox, another blood thinner which works immediately, temporarily until your blood level of Coumadin reaches the therapeutic range.  Changes to your medications: START diltiazem 120 mg every day START taking metoprolol 200 mg daily START taking warfarin 5 mg daily START taking lovenox shots twice a day until you are told to stop by your doctor  Followup Instructions: In addition to the appointments below, the oncologists are trying to schedule you an appointment in clinic.

Brief Hospital Course: 36 y/o female aditted through the ED with loose stools and most recently BRBPR. She was admitted directly from the ED to the SICU. A CT was obtained but without contrast there was no large fluid collection or hematoma visualized. The assessment of the pancreatic transplant is limited; however, there are no gross fluid collections or inflammatory changes present. Also seen is abdominal rectus diastasis with paraumbilical hernia containing a single loop of herniated bowel, with no evidence of bowel obstruction. She received large volume resuscitation, and 2 units of RBC's on [**5-3**] for hct 21% and then 2 units RBCs on [**5-4**] for 26%. Following these transfusions her hematocrit remained stable and the rectal bleeding had ceased. On [**5-4**] a tagged Red cell scan was performed, and this did not show evidence of active bleeding. Blood cultures collected on admission and then during the hospitalization were all negative. CMV viral load and CMV antibody are both negative. Stool culture, O&P and C diff x 3 were collected and were all negative. The patient continued to have multiple loose stools. She was consulted to the GI service who performed a colonoscopy. The results were: Normal mucosa in the colon and terminal ileum with cold forceps biopsies taken wich were not finalized at discharge. She also had Grade 3 internal hemorrhoids Otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum. She was started on immodium which helped decrease number of stools. Immunosuppression was changed during this hopsitalization. She was discontinued off Cellcept, and  after a few days of monotherapy on Prograf, she was started on imuran, for which she received a script for home. She was taken off valcyte after it was determined her CMV status was negative, and she is out approximately 3 months from transplant. ID consult had been obtained early in hospital course. They followed with antibiotic recommendations, and suggestions regarding neutropenia. She was initially covered with Levaquin, Vanco and Flagyl, this was eventually trimmed to Flagyl only and then no antibiotics for home were recommended. She was also profoundly neutropenic, and part of adjusting medications was goal of increasing WBCs as well as 7 days of Filgrastim. WBC nadir was 0.2. Upon discharge her stools had been mnimized, immunosuppression was adjusted and she was tolerating diet. She has also been followed by social work who will also be following her as an outpatient due to concerns that she needs encouragement to call earlier when not feeling well.

Prior to Discharge: [**2146-4-27**] PT/INR: 31.9/3.2 . IMAGING: [**2146-3-10**] AP CXR: Low lung volumes with LLL consolidation, could reflect atelectasis, however, pneumonia cannot be excluded. . [**2146-3-10**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, ABD/PELVIC CT W/CONTRAST: 1. Minimal interval increase in size of right upper quadrant pancreatic pseudocyst. Interval decrease in size of remaining loculated fluid collections. 2. No pulmonary embolism present. Large bilateral pleural effusions with associated compression atelectasis. 3. Increased amount of abdominal and pelvic free fluid. . [**2146-3-11**] BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS: 1. Persistent non-occlusive thrombus in the left common femoral vein. 2. No right lower extremity DVT. 3. Small right popliteal cyst. . [**2146-3-15**] CXR: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged as well as there is no change in extremely low lung volumes and bilateral pleural effusions, left more than right. There is mild prominence of the vasculature that appears to be more pronounced than on the prior study and might represent some degree of volume overload. The right internal jugular line tip appears to be atleast at the cavoatrial junction, but also may be present in the proximal right atrium. . [**2146-3-16**] ABD/PELVIC CT W/CONTRAST: 1. Enlargement of the previously seen fluid collection and appearance of the numerous new large collections in the peritoneum. The drained collection has significantly decreased in size. 2. Increase in pleural effusions: Left moderate and right minimal size, findings are accompanied by compressive atelectasis. 3. Minimal residual of the left common femoral vein and left external iliac vein thrombus. . [**2146-3-17**] AP CXR: In comparison with the study of [**3-15**], there is still extremely low lung volumes. Hazy opacification at the left base is consistent with pleural fluid. Obscuration of the hemidiaphragm suggests volume loss in the left lower lobe. The right lung is essentially clear and there is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. The tip of the right IJ catheter is difficult to see but appears to be in the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC. . 1. Markedly decreased size of drained collection anterior to the stomach and surroiunding the left hepatic lobe. New extensive stranding and fluid within the gastrohepatic ligament and porta hepatis, possibly induced by leakage from one of the adjacent collections or recurrent pancreatitis. Slight re-accumulation of fluid within the previously drained collection in the anterior abdomen, now measuring 14.3 x 1.6 x 5.4 cm. Otherwise, overall decrease in multiple remaining peritoneal and extraperitoneal fluid collections compared to the prior study. 2. Persistent bile duct dilation likely secondary to pancreatitis. Increased attenuation of patent portal vein from adjacent new inflammation. Persistent marked attenuation of the splenic vein. Smaller splenic infarcts. 3. Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions and associated compressive atelectasis. 4. Unchanged thrombus within the left external iliac and common iliac veins. . [**2146-3-28**] CXR: Stable size of left pleural effusion with associated consolidation which likely represents atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be excluded. . [**2146-4-13**] ABD/PELVI CT W/CONTRAST: 1. In this patient with known history of necrotizing pancreatitis, there is enhancement of the distal body and tail of the pancreas with non visualization of the remainder of the pancreas. Multiple extensive peripancreatic fluid collections have decreased in size since the prior study. 2. A small fluid collection adjacent to the inferior edge of right lobe of liver measuring 4.9 x 3.2 x 2.0 cm, is new since the prior study. 3. Unchanged left femoral vein thrombosis. Infrarenal IVC filter in place. 4. Mild interval improvement in the small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.  Compressive atelectasis of the left lower lobe is unchanged. . [**2146-4-15**] CXR: Status after withdrawal of a left-sided chest tube. Minimal apical and lateral basal pneumothorax without evidence of tension. Unchanged minimal atelectasis at the left lung base. No other changes. Normal cardiac silhouette. . [**2146-4-18**] CXR: 1. Low lung volumes with left basilar subsegmental atelectasis, likely related to the recent abdominal surgery and ongoing intra-abdominal process. 2. No appreciable residual left pneumothorax. 3. Left-sided PICC likely at the junction of that axillary and subclavian vein; this may need to be advanced into a more central vein, depending on the indication for its use. . [**2146-4-20**] ABD/PELVIC CT W/O CONTRAST: 1. Slightly decreased size of dominant central abdominal fluid collection with left drain in satisfactory position. Right catheter has been removed. 2. Other fluid collections are little changed [**2146-4-13**]. 3. Resolving left pleural effusion with pleural air secondary to left thoracic drain placement and removal. No new peripancreatic fluid collection. 4. Hypodensity of the blood pool relative to the ventricular myocardium is suggestive of anemia. 5. Moderate biliary dilatation likely secondary to CBD obstruction by pseudocyst is similar to [**2146-4-13**]. .

Brief Hospital Course: The patient was re-admitted on [**2146-3-10**] back to the General Surgical Service for evaluation and treatment of abdominal pain and tachycardia.  Admission abdominal/pelvic CT revealed minimal interval increase in size of right upper quadrant pancreatic pseudocyst, but decrease in size of remaining loculated fluid collections. Large bilateral pleural effusions with associated compression atelectasis were noted, as well as increased amount of abdominal and pelvic free fluid. He was admitted to the SICU, made NPO, started on vigorous IV fluid rescusitation, a foley was placed, and he received IV pain medication with good effect. He had a very long, and complicated hospital course. . In the process of repairing his florid necrotizing pancreatitis secondary to his history of severe gallstone pancreatitis, he ultimately developed recurrent pseudocyts, which have plagued him throughtout his hospital stays since [**48**]/[**2145**]. To date, these pseudocyts have been managed largely with percutaneous catheter drainage of the pseudocysts. Initially, during this admission, this was the approach to managing the patient's recurring pseudocyts. The patient underwent drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts on [**2146-3-10**] and [**2146-3-18**], Ultrasound and CT-guided, respectively. However, he developed an accumulating posterior retroperitoneal cyst, which continued to progress, and there was evidence of a disconnected pancreatic remnant within it. The recent drainages of the other satellite lesions have dried them up. The main retroperitoneal cyst continued to grow in size, and became symptomatic for him. He was unable to eat full meals and has a diminished capacity to keep food down, as well as a poor appetite. He also repeatedly spiked temperatures. . Given his history of a left lower extremity acute deep venous thrombosis, Vascular Surgery was consulted. In lieu of planned surgical intervention on [**2146-4-5**] for treatment of the above pseudocyst with adhesions, the patient underwent placement of a Bard G2 inferior vena cava filter, which went without complication. Then on [**2146-4-5**], the patient underwent external drainage of pancreatic pseudocyst and extended adhesiolysis, which also went well without complication (see Operative Note). After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient was returned to the floor NPO with an NG tube, on IV fluids and TPN, with a foley catheter and two JP drains in place (one in the pseudocyst and one in the abdomen to drain ascites), he was continued on a Fentanyl patch and was given a Morphine PCA with good effect. He was hemodynamically stable. . NEURO: Upon admission, the patient received IV pain medication PRN transitioned to a Morphine PCA with good effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake, he was transitioned to oral pain medications. After the surgery on [**2146-4-5**], the Chronic Pain Service was consulted. His pain was controlled once the Fentanyl dose was increased to 75mcg/72Hr plus the Morphine PCA. When again tolerating a diet post-operatively, the PCA was discontinued, and he was started on oral pain medication in addition to the Fentanyl patch with continued good effect. He remained neurologically intact. . CV: Upon admission, tachycardia responded to vigorous IV fluid rescusitation and beta-blockade with Metoprolol 50mg TID. Metoprolol was increased to 75mg TID with eventual excellent rate and BP control. By discharge, the Metoprolol was decreased to 50mg [**Hospital1 **]. The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. . PULMONARY: Tachypnea on admission. Chest CTA revealed large bilateral pleural effusions with associated compression atelectasis. Tachypnea resolved with diuresis with Lasix and supplemental oxygen. He was given Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizer treatments, good pulmonary toilet and use of the incentive spirrometry were encouraged, and the patient received chest PT with improvement in overall respiratory status. Able to wean off supplemental oxygen. CXR on [**3-17**] revealed still extremely low lung volumes. Hazy opacification at the left base is consistent with pleural fluid. Obscuration of the hemidiaphragm suggests volume loss in the left lower lobe. The right lung was essentially clear and there was no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Starting on [**4-12**], he spiked a temperature to 103 PO and his WBC increased from 13 to 23,000.  He had a CT abdomen performed which demonstrated a left pleural effusion on the upper cuts of the abdomen. Thoracic surgery was consulted for management of the pleural effusion. On [**2146-4-14**], he underwent ultrasound-guided thorocentesis and placement of left pleural pigtail catheter. Plural fluid for culture, gram stain, cytology, chemistries, and AFB was sent. The pleural pigtail catheter was removed on [**4-15**]; post-removal CXR revealed minimal apical and lateral basal pneumothorax without evidence of tension. Unchanged minimal atelectasis at the left lung base. A follow-up CXR on [**2146-4-18**] showed continued low lung volumes with left basilar subsegmental atelectasis, likely related to the recent abdominal surgery and ongoing intra-abdominal process. No appreciable residual left pneumothorax was seen. The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoitn thereafter. Respiratory toilet, incentive spirrometry, and frequent ambulation was encouraged. . GU/FEN: On admission, the patient was made NPO and he received vigorous IV fluid rescusitation. A foley catheter was placed. Allowed clears on [**3-11**] and [**3-12**], but an NG tube was placed on [**3-13**] for increased abdominal distension and emesis resulting with 1400mL bilious output. After successful clamp trial overnight, the NG tube was discontinued on [**3-15**] in the morning. Given persistent problems with tolerating oral intake, a PICC was placed, and TPN was started on [**2146-3-14**]. With the decision to proceed to surgery, TPN was continued through [**2146-4-12**]. When not NPO for procedures, his diet was advanced back to low fat regular with good tolerability and intake. When the foley catheter was removed after surgery, he was able to void without problem. Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary. Electrolytes were routinely followed, and repleted when necessary. . GI: Admission liver and pancreatic enzymes were elevated. Shortly after admission, the patient underwent ultrasound-guided pseudocyst drainage measuring 1.7 liters of fluid with a drainage catheter left in place to gravity on [**2146-3-10**]. Liver and pancreatic enzymes began trending down. Follow-up abdominal/pelvic CT on [**3-16**] demonstrated enlargement of the previously seen fluid collection and appearance of the numerous new large collections in the peritoneum. The drained collection had significantly decreased in size. On [**3-18**], the patient returned to Interventional Radiology for drainage of an anterior collection, and placement of a new drainage catheter to gravity. The previous drain was removed, and upper abdominal pseudocyst was succesfully drained with a catheter left in place to gravity. Unfortunately, as noted above, he developed an accumulating posterior retroperitoneal cyst, which continued to progress, and there was evidence of a disconnected pancreatic remnant within it. He underwent external drainage of pancreatic pseudocyst and extended adhesiolysis as described above. A (L) flank drain was left in place. After the surgery, his symptoms improved. . ID: Admission blood cultures were negative. [**3-10**] fluid culture had no growth. On [**3-17**] after receiving FFPs, the patient mounted a fever with a Tmax 101.5 PO. Blood cultures were negative. Fluid cutlure from the [**3-18**] drainage also revealed no growth. The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection. Admission MRSA screen was negative. After the [**2146-4-5**] surgery, cultures from the peritoneal fluid on [**4-14**], the (L) JP on [**4-19**], and the flank drain on [**4-21**] all grew out MRSA. The patient had been started on empiric IV Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Flagyl when he spiked a temperature on [**4-14**]. Fluconazole for empiric coverage after the thorocentesis was started on [**4-15**]. Flagyl, Cipro, and Fluconazole were discontinued on [**4-16**]. Cipro restarted on [**4-21**]. Infectious Disease was consulted for discharge antibiotic recommendations; their input was greatly appreciated. Cipro was discomntinued, and oral Levofloxacin and Flagyl started on [**4-26**] with Vancomycin continued. At discharge, the patient was sent home on a two week course oral Linezolid, and a total of four weeks of oral Levofloxacin and Flagyl. . ENDOCRINE: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout his stay when he was on TPN; sliding scale insulin was administered accordingly. He did not require exogenous insulin. . HEMATOLOGY: Upon admission, Coumadin was stopped, and the patient received 5 untis of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFPs) prior to fluid collection drainage in Intervention Radiology. On [**3-17**], FFPs were again administered in preparation for IR drainage of a large anterior abdominal fluid collection, but was stopped after the patient experienced severe lower back pain after initiation of the second unit of FFP. On [**3-18**], he received a total of 4 units of FFPs prior to IR drainage of the aforementioned collection. Prior to [**2146-4-5**] surgery, the patient received 2 units of PRBCs for a HCT of 22.2. He did not require any further blood products after this date. At discharge, his HCT was 23.7. . PROPHYLAXIS: History left common iliac DVT and HITs. Repeat duplex ultra-sound on admission confirmed persistent non-occlusive thrombus in the left common femoral vein; no right DVT was seen. Chest CTA did not reveal a PE. On admission, Coumadin stopped, and Agatroban started. After the drainage of the collection on [**3-10**], Agatroban was stopped, and Coumadin restarted. Coumadin also restarted after reversal for second collection drainage. After the surgery on [**2146-4-5**], the patient was restarted on Argatroban. He was again converted back to Coumadin prior to discharge, at which time the INR was therapeutic at 3.2 on a Coumadin dose of 2.5mg daily. INR goal 2.5 with a therapeutic range of [**3-2**]. . MOBILITY: The patient worked with Physical and Occupation therapy extensively. By discharge, he was able to ambulate independently. He was discharge home with PT and OT services. . At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating with minimal assistance, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.  He was discharged home with VNA and PT services. The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.  Medications on Admission: 1.

Also, please take any new medications as prescribed.  Please get plenty of rest, continue to ambulate several times per day, and drink adequate amounts of fluids.  Avoid lifting weights greater than [**6-6**] lbs until you follow-up with your surgeon, who will instruct you further regarding activity restrictions.  Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery while taking pain medications.  Please follow-up with your surgeon and Primary Care Provider (PCP) as advised. . JP Drain Care: *Please look at the site every day for signs of infection (increased redness or pain, swelling, odor, yellow or bloody discharge, warm to touch, fever). *Maintain suction of the bulb. *Note color, consistency, and amount of fluid in the drain. Call the doctor, nurse practitioner, or VNA nurse if the amount increases significantly or changes in character. *Be sure to empty the drain frequently.  Record the output, if instructed to do so. *You may shower; wash the area gently with warm, soapy water. *Keep the insertion site clean and dry otherwise. *Avoid swimming, baths, hot tubs; do not submerge yourself in water. *Make sure to keep the drain attached securely to your body to prevent pulling or dislocation. .  General Drain Care:  *Please look at the site every day for signs of infection (increased redness or pain, swelling, odor, yellow or bloody discharge, warm to touch, fever). *If the drain is connected to a collection container, please note color, consistency, and amount of fluid in the drain.  Call the doctor, nurse practitioner, or VNA nurse if the amount increases significantly or changes in character. Be sure to empty the drain frequently.  Record the output, if instructed to do so. *Wash the area gently with warm, soapy water or 1/2 strength hydrogen peroxide followed by saline rinse, pat dry, and place a drain sponge. Change daily and as needed. *Keep the insertion site clean and dry otherwise. *Avoid swimming, baths, hot tubs; do not submerge yourself in water. *Make sure to keep the drain attached securely to your body to prevent pulling or dislocation. . Coumadin (Warfarin):  What is this medicine used for?  This medicine is used to thin the blood so that clots will not form.  How does it work?  Warfarin changes the body's clotting system. It thins the blood to prevent clots from forming.  What you should contact your healthcare provider [**Name Initial (PRE) **]:  Signs of a life-threatening reaction. These include wheezing; chest tightness; fever; itching; bad cough; blue skin color; fits; or swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat, severe dizziness or passing out, falls or accidents, especially if you hit your head. Talk with healthcare provider even if you feel fine, significant change in thinking clearly and logically, severe headache, severe back pain, severe belly pain, black, tarry, or bloody stools, blood in the urine, nosebleeds, coughing up blood, vomiting blood, unusual bruising or bleeding,  severe menstrual bleedin, or rash.  Call your doctor if you are unable to eat for several days, for whatever reason. Also call if you have stomach problems, vomiting, or diarrhea that lasts more than 1 day. These problems  could affect your Coumadin??????/warfarin dosage.  Coumadin (Warfarin) and diet:  Certain foods and beverages can impair the effect of warfarin. For this reason, it's important to pay attention to what you eat  while taking this medication.  Until recently, doctors advised [**Name5 (PTitle) **] taking warfarin to avoid foods high in vitamin K. This is because large amounts of vitamin K can counteract the benefits of warfarin. However, recent research shows that rather than eliminating vitamin K from your diet, it is more important to be consistent in your dietary vitamin K intake.  These foods contain vitamin K:  Fruits and vegetables, such as: Kiwi, Blueberries, Broccoli, Cabbage, [**Location (un) 2831**] sprouts, Green onions, Asparagus, Cauliflower,  Peas, Lettuce, Spinach, Turnip, collard, and mustard greens, Parsley, Kale, Endive. Meats, such as: Beef liver, Pork liver. Other: Mayonnaise, Margarine, Canola oil, Soybean oil, Vitamins,  Soybeans and Cashews.  Limit alcohol. Alcohol can affect your Coumadin??????/warfarin dosage  but it does not mean you must avoid all alcohol. Serious problems can occur with alcohol and Coumadin??????/warfarin when you drink more than 2 drinks a day or when you change your usual pattern. Binge drinking is not good for you. Be careful on special occasions or holidays, and drink only what you usually would on any regular day of the week.  Monitoring:  The doctor decides how much Coumadin??????/warfarin you need by testing your blood. The test measures how fast your blood is clotting and lets the doctor know if your dosage should change. If your blood test is too high, you might be at risk for bleeding problems. If it is too low, you might be at risk for forming clots. Your doctor has decided on a range on the blood test that is right for you. The blood test used for monitoring is called an INR.  Use of Other medications:  When Coumadin??????/warfarin is taken with other medicines it can change the way other medicines work. Other medicines can also change the way Coumadin??????/warfarin works. It is very important to  talk with your doctor about all of the other medicines that you are taking, including over-the-counter medicines, antibiotics, vitamins, or herbal products.

Patient's admission comprised of 2 day MICU stay with continued hemodynamic stability, followed by several days on the medicine [**Hospital1 **] for monitoring, physical therapy, treatment for hypoxia and neurologic evaluation.  1. Upper GI Bleed: PUD likely [**3-7**] NSAIDs.  Pt was continued on PPI, initially IV and transitioned to oral.  Her hematocrit was monitored twice daily initially, and then daily.  All NSAIDS and Actonel were held, with a recommendation to continue to avoid these medications after discharge.  Gastrin level was elevated, but believed secondary to PPI therapy.  Pt will require outpatient GI follow-up.  Finally, concern regarding the level of insight underlying the patient's large doses of NSAIDs, coupled with her family's concerns about her psychiatric history, prompted psychiatric and neurologic evaluations.  Both of these services followed the patient through her admission.  2) Question of cholescystitis: RUQ U/S for ? sludge and GB wall thickening on CT. U/S equivocal. HIDA scan negative. [**Doctor First Name **] consulted but ascertained that there were no further surgical needs.  Cultures and hepatitis serologies were unrevealing, and exam and LFTs normalized.  Increased LFTs were likely [**3-7**] hypotension on presentation.  3) Elevated LFTS: DDx includes cholecytitis, effect of hypotension, muscle damage.  Likely dignosis was hypotension on presentation given negative work-up delineated above.  Held Lipitor given transaminitis for outpatient review.  4) Bradycardia: possibly due to massive GI Bleed, or elev K and acidosis, resolved in ICU  5) Metabolic acidosis: -likely lactic acidosis from hypotention and hypovolemic shock, although lactate mildly elevated (but checked after resucitation), aspirin negative, resolved in ICU.  6) Leukocytosis: some evidence of PNA on CT with 4+ GPCs on GS, also ? gallbladder wall edema on CT.  Evidence lacking for cholecytitis, MICU team hypothesis was that elevation [**3-7**] demargination under stress.  Continue to monitor, f/u cultures, d/w PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was on vanco/unasyn in the ICU, narrowed to levofloxacin as she had suggestion of pneumonia but no other infection.  7) Wheezing/SOB: Patient with likely COPD as she has smoked [**3-8**] PPD x over 30 years.  The patient improved with nebulizer treatments, and will be discharged on bronchodilators with outpatient follow-up.  8) Neuro/Pyschiatric: Patient on Fluoxetine, clonazepam and Anafranil at home, which were originally held in the ICU. Psychiatry consult was called after discussion with the patient's sister, who was concerned about her inability to work and general lack of ability to care for herself, most clearly manifested financially.  The psychiartry consult had no medication recommendations, and her TSH/B12/Folate/RPR were all negative or within normal limits as appropriate.  They suspected a cognitive problem and were concerned by her lack of judgement however, and also recommended an MRI.  The read of this MRI was notable for multiple T2 high-signal-intensity abnormalities in the periventricular white matter and centrum semiovale.  The findings suggested a demyelinating disorder, or potentially a microvascular angiopathy.  There was also an area of abnormality in the left periatrial white matter, which could represent one of these demyelinating areas or could represent a small subacute infarct.  The neurology team recommended an LP for routine analysis, oligoclonal bands, and ACE level to evaluate for multiple sclerosis and sarcoidosis; [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, CRP, and ESR levels to evaluate for vasculitis; formal neuropsych evaluation as an outpatient and follow-up in behavioral neurology clinic.  The LP was performed prior to discharge, and the bulk of the serologic testing was performed.  The patient's PCP will [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] these studies as an outpatient.  In addition, the psychiatry team tried to get in touch with her PCP and psychiatrist as an outpatient, but had been thusfar unsucessful at the time of discharge.  9) FEN: Patient was tolerating a normal house diet at the time of discharge.  10) follow-up: A follow-up appointment was arranged for the patient with her PCP before discharge.  She was also given instructions for neurology, behavioral neurology, psychiatry and neuropsychiatric testing follow-up.  Finally, she was recommended to have her hematocrit checked the week following discahrge to ensure continued stability.

Blood Culture, Routine (Pending):   Brief Hospital Course: An 89 year old gentleman with systolic CHF, chronic foley who presented from rehab with Psuedomonal/E. Coli urosepsis.  #) Urosepsis:  The patient was admitted to the MICU for management of urosepsis.  While there he was maintained on neosynephrine for 2 days.  He was started on Vancomycin & Zosyn. The patient was called out to the floor on Zosyn & Tobramycin. Further microbiologic data suggested a treatment change to Tobramycin & Ceftazidime to be continued until [**2101-1-12**]. Throughout this admission the patient's chronic foley due to bladder diverticulum remained in place and regularly irrigated.  -Ceftazidime 2g IV Q12h last dose [**2101-1-12**] -Tobramycin 100mg IV Q24, decrease dose to 80mg on [**2101-1-9**] to finish course on [**2101-1-12**]. -Foley requires hand irrigation q4-6 hours, no continuous bladder irrigation.  #) Atrial Fibrillation:  The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation for which he is on chronic anti-coagulation and metoprolol.  Due to his poor PO intake and self-sustained rate control, the patient will not be continued on metoprolol.  His coumadin was held for much of his admission given a supratherapeutic INR.  He will be discharged on 2mg daily with PT levels to be followed twice weekly, goal [**12-21**].  #) Chronic DVTs: Anticoagulated as above.  #) Malnutrition/Wound Care (Sacral Decubitus & leg ulcers):  The patient is tolerating limited PO with siginificant aspiration risk & aspiration events.  Other feeding options were discussed with the family but they have opted to maintain oral feeding. Of note, the patient has a low Albumin in the 1s with significant wound care issues as well as significant scrotal edema.  The patient was admitted on Zinc, Vitamin C, & Vitamin B but due to his poor ability to consume pills these medicines have not been continued.  #) Leukocytosis: The patient has had a maintained elevated white blood cell count while admitted. This is likely due to his ongoing Pseudomonal UTI/chronic foley.  An assay for C. diff was sent off and the results will be called to the accepting facility. - If C. Diff positive, will begin Flagyl 500mg IV Q8 at the discretion of the family.  #) CHF: The patient has a history of Congestive Heart failure. Given his renal failure and hypotension his lasix was initially held. Given his tenuous renal failure we have not restarted Lasix on discharge.  #) Pain: The patient was maintained on a fentanyl patch and with tylenol and morphine IV.  On discharge he will be transitioned to sublingual or liquid morphine for pain control.  # ARF: The patient has persistent renal failure with baseline creatinine 0.8, 1. on discharge. All medicines were renally dosed.  # Hypertension:  The patient's beta blocker and ace inhibitor were not continued.  # Type 2 Diabetes:  The patient was continued on an insulin sliding scale but did not require insulin.  We recommend reducing his finger sticks to once daily only.  # Anemia: The patient had fluctuating blood volume without clear blood loss other than phlebotomy.  He was not transfused on this admission.  # L heel stage II pressure ulcer: Wound care as above.  # Dementia:  The patient has chronic dementia.  He was unable to reliably take food by mouth, however in accordance with the family wishes he was fed but kept on aspiration precautions.  Medications on Admission: Medications: 1.

No acute findings in the abdomen or pelvis to explain patient's fevers, within the limits of this non-contrast enhanced technique. 2. Tip of the Foley catheter within the distal ureter of the transplanted kidney causing mild hydroureteronephrosis. No perinephric collections or masses. No evidence for abscess. 3. Fecal loading in the rectum without bowel obstruction   Brief Hospital Course: *Please note that pt left against medical advice* . . 53 y/o immunosuppressed female s/p renal transplant in [**Month (only) 958**] [**2172**], presenting from PCP's office with three weeks of chills, now with documented fevers tachycardia, borderline hypotension, and hypoglycemia. . 1. Sepsis secondary to ecoli bacteremia: On presentation, meet SIRS criteria with fevers, tachycardia and mild bandemia from suspected infectious source especially given immunosuppression. Pancultured in the emergency department and placed on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and cefepime.  To evaluate for etiology, CXR and CT scan of abdomen was performed with no apparent abnormality besides stool impaction in the rectum.  Urinalysis did have minimal blood and white blood cells, but culture returned negative.  Stool cx returned positive for cdiff and patient was started on flagyl.  Blood cx from [**10-5**] grew pansensitive ecoli and antibiotics were subsequently narrowed to ciprofloxacin (and flagyl).  The most likely source of ecoli bacteremia was thought to be translocation from gut in setting of mild colitis.  The patient was transiently hypotensive in the emergency department, but responded to fluid boluses.  With antibiotic therapy, she defervesced, tachycardia resolved, and subjective complaints of chills improved.  Surveillance blood cx from [**10-6**] were negative for 48 hrs, pt was continued on cipro/flagyl but developed leukopenia and flagyl was discontinued (bc can contribute to leukopenia) and changed to PO vancomycin. Authorization for PO vanco could not be obtained over the weekend and pt decided to leave against medical advice in lieu of waiting for vanco authorization. Pt was advised to continue vanco for 2 weeks more after completing 2 week course of cipro. She has outpt f/u in transplant clinic to have WBC count checked (in addition to INR and tacro levels, as below). At time of discharge, pt was abebrile >72 hrs, had no diarrhea, no abd pain, no N/V. Of note, mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued as well prior to discharge given leukopenia. Bactrim and valcyte, though also can cause leukopenia, were continued as pt has been on these for a long time without complications. Most likely leukopenia was due to recent initiation of flagyl, and should improve on cipro/vanco regimen.  MMF was held until follow up as this may have been contributing to her neutropenia. . 2. ESRD s/p transplant: History of lupus nephritis s/p renal transplant on cellcept, tacrolimus and prednisone.  Baseline creatinine is in the 1s, but has been slowly increasing since [**Month (only) 205**] and has been as high as 2.7 in the recent past.  Etiology of developping renal insufficiency is unclear: CT scan with no evidence of obstruction, urinalysis without active sediment to suggest recurrent lupus nephritis.  The patient may have chronic volume depletion, she is on bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] which may artifactually increase creatinine.  Also, it is unclear whether she is compliant with her immunosuppressants at home.  A renal biopsy may be pursued as an outpatient.  During hospitalization, renal function was trended daily and patient continued on immunosuppressants with bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].  Daily tacrolimus levels were also followed with level adjusted as needed. Goal level [**7-20**], tacro level 6.4 at discharge, per renal consult continued 2mg [**Hospital1 **] dosing of tacrolimus. Cellcept was discontinued prior to discharge given leukopenia (as above). Pt has f/u in renal transplant clinic to have tacro levels rechecked and to check WBC count, will modulate immunosuppression regimen based on those results. . 3. Antiphospholipid syndrome:  on longterm anticoagulation with warfarin for history of APLS (Anticardiolipin Ab's showing elevated IgG and normal IgM in [**3-17**] and [**7-17**]) with multiple prior thrombotic occlusions of dialysis fistula. PT/INR followed daily with warfarin supratherapeutic on [**10-6**] to 4.7.  INR at 2.9 to 2.1 on discharge (goal [**1-13**]). Coumadin was restarted at 1mg daily with f/u day after discharge to check INR levels and to adjust coumadin accordingly. . 4.  SLE: Outpatient rheumatology notes indicate patient diagnosed in [**2165**] and initially seen at [**Hospital1 112**] lupus clinic. Last [**Hospital1 18**] rheumatology clinic visit [**1-20**], documenting history of lupus nephritis and AVN of ankles  with last documented [**Doctor First Name **] positive 1:160 in [**2169**], though dsDNA Ab's have been negative when checked since [**2171**].  No findings on history or physical consistent with lupus flair. . 5.  Hypertension: Pt has history of hypertension treated with metoprolol only, with past systolic blood pressure measurements documented in the 110-140 range, per OMR. Documented BP's in ED generally in low 100s, with IVF infusion.  Given systemic HTN, home metoprolol initially held but restarted prior to discharge. . 6. Hyperlipidemia: Last lipid panel in [**2172-9-10**], with TC 144, HDL 39, LDL 81, TG 120. Not currently receiving treatment, but was taking simvastatin through [**2172-3-11**]. . 7. Hyponatremia: Mild, without alterations in mental status. Likely poor PO intake over past days-weeks would suggest hypovolemic hyponatremia. Improved following IVF bolus in emergency department. . 8. Osteoporosis: Last bone densitometry scan in [**2173-4-10**], consistent with osteoporosis, in setting of chronic glucocorticoid therapy and hyperparathyroidism.   Medications on Admission: 1.

Persistent shift of normally midline structures to the right of 6 mm. Close followup recommended.   Final Report STUDY: CT of the head without contrast.  HISTORY: 72-year-old male with subdural hematoma. Assess for residual blood.  COMPARISONS: CT [**2179-4-2**].  TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of the head were obtained.  FINDINGS: There has been interval removal of an intracranial catheter. The patient is status post left frontal craniotomy. A mixed attenuation collection overlies primarily the left frontoparietal convexity. There are areas of increased attenuation within this collection, which suggest ongoing bleeding. Several areas of pneumocephalus are compatible with recent craniotomy. The total diameter of this collection measures approximately 11 mm, which is slightly larger compared to the previous measurements of 8 mm allowing for slight differences in technique. There is persistence of adjacent sulcal enfacement, particularly notable superiorly within the frontal lobe. There is shift of normally midline structures to the right of approximately 6 mm, which is probably unchanged compared to the previous shift of 5 mm. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear grossly clear. Multiple staples and subcutaneous emphysema are noted along the subcutaneous tissues overlying the left frontal bone and site of craniotomy.  IMPRESSION: Persistence of left extra-axial collection status post catheter removal with several areas of increased density suggestive of ongoing hemorrhage. Persistent shift of normally midline structures to the right of approximately 6 mm. Continued close followup is advised.   The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.   DR.

Patent major itnra and extra cranial arteries without focal flow limiting stenosis, occlusion or aneurysm more than 3 mm within the resolution of MRA.    Final Report INDICATION: 72-year-old man with new-onset dysarthria several days after craniotomy for SDH, to evaluate for vascular abnormalities.  COMPARISON: CT of the head done on [**2179-4-6**].  TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging of the head was performed without and with IV contrast. 3D TOF MR angiogram of the head, contrast- enhanced MR angiogram of the neck were performed, MIP reformations of the arteries were obtained.  FINDINGS:  MRI OF THE HEAD: The left-sided convexity based subdural hematoma is again visualized, with small amount of air and mild displacement of the cerebral parenchyma. There is also edema of the left cerebral hemisphere, with decrease in the size of the cerebral sulci, the overall appearance not significantly changed compared to the prior CT study done on [**2179-4-6**], allowing for the differences in the modalities. There are multiple small FLAIR hyperintense foci noted in the cerebral white matter on both sides, in the frontal and the parietal lobes, periventricular and subcortical in location. There are no areas of restricted diffusion in the brain parenchyma. The visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses are clear. Small areas of increased signal intensity are noted in the left mastoid air cells from mucosal thickening/fluid.  3D TOF MR ANGIOGRAM OF THE HEAD: The left vertebral artery is dominant. The right posterior cerebral artery and the P1 and P2 segments are slightly tortuous with tortuous course of the junction of the P1 and P2 segments. The P1 segment on the left side is not visualized, with a fetal PCA pattern. The A1 segment of the left anterior cerebral artery is slightly small in caliber and likely hypoplastic. The anterior communicating artery is faintly visualized.  No areas of abnormal enhancement are noted in the brain parenchyma. Enhancement of the meninges, likely relates to the recent surgery in the subdural hematoma on the left side. The tip of the basilar artery is slightly prominent related to the infundibula at the origins of the branch vessels.  MR ANGIOGRAM OF THE NECK: The origins of the arch vessels are patent. There is common origin of the brachiocephalic trunk and the left common carotid artery, representing bovine arch variant. There is mild narrowing, at the origin of the left vertebral artery, which may relate to tortuosity or stenosis. However, there is no flow limitation distally. The right vertebral artery is small in caliber diffusely likely related to mild hypoplasia with the left being dominant, the narrowing is more prominent at the origin and v4 segment ; however, there is no flow limitation. The common carotid arteries are patent, as well as the cervical internal carotid arteries without focal flow- limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm. There is a short segment of mild- moderate stenosis in the left common carotid artery, seen only on the MIPS and not on the source images and hecne is of doubtful significance- no flow limitation distally. (series 106, im 6; series 108, im 5)  The delayed phase images are not obtained on the MR angiogram.  IMPRESSION:  1. No acute infarction.  2. Small-to-moderate size left-sided subdural hematoma, with small amount of air, and mass effect on the left cerebral hemisphere, with edema, unchanged compared to the most recent CT head study done on [**2179-4-6**].  3. Patent major intra- and extra-cranial arteries, without focal flow- limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm within the limitations of MR angiogram. Please see the additional details above.  4. Narrowing at the origin of the left vertebral artery, question tortuosity, or stenosis, no flow limitation distally; ? stenosis in the left common carotid artery- seen only on MIPS but not on source images; no flow limitation distally.

STUDY: CT of the chest without contrast.  INDICATION: 70-year-old female with history of myelodysplastic syndrome presenting with fevers, acute hypoxia. Assess for infiltrates.  COMPARISONS: [**2138-9-24**].  TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of the lungs are acquired. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were then obtained.  CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are several, subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes. No pathologically enlarged axillary or hilar lymph nodes are present. A small pericardial effusion is relatively unchanged in size compared to the examination four days prior. A moderate- to large-sized hiatal hernia is also again noted.  Lung windows demonstrate dramatic interval change with diffuse, ground-glass opacities present throughout both lungs, mostly new compared to the previous examination. A few pulmonary nodules within the right lung are again noted and unchanged compared to the previous examination. Incidental note is also made of bibasilar atelectasis.  No lytic or blastic lesions within the osseous structures are noted. Limited views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.  IMPRESSION: Multifocal air-space process throughout both lungs dramatically new compared to examination from four days prior. Given the non-pathologic but prominent mediastinal lymphadenopathy, infectious etiologies including atypical infections if the patient is immunocompromised should be considered. ARDS given the timing of these findings is also a diagnostic consideration. Clinical correlation is advised. No pleural effusion.  Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 4:55 pm by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 7747**] over the telephone on [**2138-9-28**].  [**2138-10-28**] HCT 28.8 platelet 67 wbc 3.5 Na 130 creat 1.9 BUN 25 K 4.5  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 70 y.o. woman with myelodysplastic syndrome and resultant pancytopenia and recurrent GIB associated with ulcerations in her small intestine. . # GI Bleeding: Likely due from previously discovered small intestinal ulcerations, with increased propensity for bleeding given thrombocytopenia. No evidence of UGIB. Baseline hct 32, was 22 on admission.  On the second day of hospitalization the patient had further bleeding per rectum, became hypotensive, and had sinus tachycardia to 140.  She was soon transferred to the MICU.  While in the ICU, Angiography did not show active bleed, although unable to catheterize the [**Female First Name (un) 899**].  Tagged RBC study also did not show site of bleed.  At present, there are no surgical or endoscopic options, so will continue with supportive care. NG lavage was negative.  The patient received numerous PRBC transfusions.  Platelets remain above 50 after many platelent transufsions.  After stabilization, the patient was transferred to the floor where she remained hemodynamically stable for the remainder of her hospitalization.  She did have occasional BRBPR, and always remained guaiac positive.  She continued to receive prbc's nearly every other day to maintain a stable hematocrit, and she received HLA matched platelets on nearly a daily basis to maintain her platelet count over 50. . # Neutropenic fever: The patient finished her 5th day of decitabine for MDS treatment on [**9-12**].  Previous to decitabine therapy the patient had adequate cell counts, and after decitabine the patient became progressively  neutropenic.  On return to the floor form the MICU the patient proceeded to spike daily fevers as high as 103.0, with associated rigors.  The source of fever was not identified.  Daily blood cultures were negative. stool was C.Diff negative.  The patient placed  on several antibiotics, including vancomycin, Zosyn, Flagyl, and fluconazole, and continued to spike. CT chest/Abdomen/Pelvis on [**9-24**] did not reveal a source of fevers. CT Pelvis revealed fat stranding and questionable external iliac [**Last Name (un) **] thrombus, followup MRI showed fat stranding but no thrombus. Antibiotics eventually switched to Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl (cefepime was discontinued secondary to drug rash), to Vanc/Aztreonam/Caspofungin. The patient desaturated on [**9-28**] to 78%, and CT chest showed extensive infiltrates.  Clinical suspicion for PCP was high, and after consulting ID, the patient was maintained on Vanc/Caspo/Meropenem, and the patient was begun on Bactrim and steroids empirically, unable to perform bronchoscopy with the high likelihood of being unable to extubate her.  Soon after Bactrim administration her fevers stopped. She was continued with a full 14 day course of IV Bactrim. After completing this course she was transitioned to Bactrim DS 3 times weekly.  . #O2 desaturation-Patient began to desat on [**9-26**]. Thought initially to be due to fluid overload in setting of increased platelet and prbc transfusions, and CT on [**9-24**] showing bibasilar atelectasis.  Oxygen improved with lasix on [**9-26**] and [**9-27**], and patient was saturating at 94% on room air on [**9-27**].  Patient desaturated to 78% on [**9-28**].  CT chest showed extensive infiltrates.  ID reccomended broad antibiotic coverage, and biggest concern was for PCP in the setting of an immunocompromised patient.  She was subsequently begun on Bactrim and steroids.  Soon after bactrim administration the patient stopped spiking fevers, however she persisted with low oxygen saturation and required 6L O2 by nasal cannula.  The patient's O2 saturation ranged from 89-94%, and appeared to improve with lasix administration.  She occasionally required masked ventilation to maintain O2 saturation over 90%.  After six days of bactrim therapy, her bactrim was discontinued out of concern that it was contributing to the patient's neutropenia. Primaquine and clindamycin were begun instead.  Her neutrophil count slowly increased over a period of four days from 40 to 170, she remained afebrile, but her oxygenation did not improve. On [**10-12**] the patient was transferred back to the ICU after having another acute oxygen desaturation of 78% on 6LNC. Patient was stabilized and transeferred back to the floor on NRB 100%, she continued on IV antibiotic regimen of meropenem and Bactrim. She remained afebrile and was continued on Bactrim and voriconazole. She was able to be weaned to 99% on 3L nasal cannula prior to discharge. Her prednisone dose was tapered, she was discharge on Prednisone 30mg AM, 10mg PM per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] who will follow her at the rehabilitation facility. Given her risk of GIB it was very important to taper her steroid dose.  # MDS: The patient is s/p decitabine treatment from [**9-12**], and gradually became neutropenic.  While in the hospital her cyclosporine was discontinued.  She was administered neupogen and her counts eventually recovered slowly. Her last ANC on the day of discharge was 3100. Further treatment for underlying disease at Dr.[**Name (NI) 6168**] discretion.  # Hyponatremia: Urine electrolytes consistent with SIADH, likely from the pulmonary process. She was fluid restricted to 1L, it was diffucult to mantain this restriction given the IV medications. Once she was taken off the IV meds her sodium level rose, 130 upon dishcharge. She was continued on salt tabs.  #Sundowning: Her mental status would wax and wane at nighttime, multifactorial etiology of undrlying infection, hypoxia, hyponatremia and medications. Her medication list was reviewed and with treatment of her underlying disease her mental status improved. She was alert and oriented at discharge.  Medications on Admission: Home Medications: 1.

Brief Hospital Course: 64yo M with HIV, HBV, HCV, HCC, cirrhosis status post orthotopic liver [**Year (4 digits) **] ([**6-4**]), a history of DVT/PE and nephrolithiasis, who was admitted on [**5-28**] for antibiotic treatment of a VRE UTI and bridge from coumadin to heparin for lithotripsy procedure [**6-1**].  His post-operative course was complicated by fevers, confusion, unstable vitals consistent with urosepsis/shock, requiring transfer to the  MICU and broad antibiotic therapy, now transferred back to the [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name 679**] service, stable, and ready for discharge. . # UTI/Urosepsis/Urolithiasis: On admission, an oupatient culture was reported as growing Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus. Treatment of a VRE UTI infection with daptomycin was initated on [**5-28**], with a documented negative urine culture on [**5-31**].    On [**6-1**] patient underwent lithotripsy and placement of a stent.  During the middle of the night, he was noted to have altered mental status.  He had taken off his heparin gtt and was walking around saying that he was ready to go home.  They continued to hold his heparin gtt at that time.  He was placed back in bed, and noted to be febrile with a Tm of 102.7 at 0030 this morning.  His BP was 80/d at the time, HR in the 50s.  He received 1L bolus without effect in his BP.  At 530 this morning, his BP was 104/d and HR 88.  After the 1L of IVFs, his O2 sat was noted to be 87% on RA.  He was placed on 2L NC and improved.  He received a second L bolus and at 8 am this morning, was rigoring again with T 102.6, BP 110/50, P 100, R 36 and 97% on 2L.  The MICU was called for transfer. A urine culture drawn at this time grew out polymicrobial (klebsiella, enterobacter, nonpsuedomonas nonfermenter) and the patient was appropriately started on meropenem on [**6-4**].   Urology confirmed placement and draining of stent on [**6-4**].  A larger foley was placed to aid in the drainage of the stones.  On [**6-7**] the patient had a PICC line placed for outpatient antibiotic administration.  On [**6-7**], per ID recommendations relating to culture sensitivies, the meropenem was switched to Cipro.  The patient completed his course of daptomycin on [**6-12**].  The patient will continue PO Cipro until [**6-15**].  He will follow up with the [**Hospital 159**] clinic as an outpatient.  He will follow up with ID as an outpatient. . Hospital Acquired Pneumonia: The patient was transferred to the MICU with hypoxia thought to be secondary to an aspiration. Other etiologies considered were hypoxia secondary to volume overload from IV fluid boluses (last echo in [**2132**] was normal) and pneumonia. Antibiotic coverage for hospital acquired pneumonia with meropenem was started on [**6-2**] and vancomycin was added on [**6-3**] to provide better coverage for MRSA.  CXR on [**6-3**] showed a stable left lower lobe consolidation with new opacity and air bronchograms in the right middle lobe that could possible be atelectasis.  Respiratory aspirate cultures  were without growth.  On transfer to the floors, the patient was continued on meropenem for possible hospital acquired pneumonia.  Vancomycin was stopped as per ID's recommendations.  Antibiotics were continued as discussed above. . History of DVT/PE: The patient had a PE in [**2132**] and was placed on heparin. On arrival to the hospital, a heparin bridge was initiated to prepare for the lithotripsy procedure.  On [**6-1**] the heparin was held, the patient underwent the lithotripsy, and the heparin gtt was restarted after the procedure.  The heparin was held during the events leading up the [**Hospital 228**] transfer to the MICU, resulting in subtherapeutic PTTs.  He was restarted on heparin in the MICU and bridged to coumadin.  On transfer to the floors, his INR was supratherapeutic, requiring adjustment of the coumadin to 5mg.  When the patient was transitioned to cipro, his coumadin was empirically lowered to 3mg.  His INR trended downwards and his coumadin was increased to 5mg.  He will have his INR checked with this labs on Monday [**6-14**] and reviewed at his clinic appointment on [**6-16**]. . S/P OLT: The patient has a hx of hepatitis B, HCC, and is s/p OLT one year prior to presentation.  On admission he had stable LFTs and no signs of encephalopathy on tacrolimus, cellcept, and bactrim prophyllaxis.  Following his lithotripsy, the patient developed with abdominal distension concerning for ascites, confirmed by ultrasound, along with positive asterixis.  In combination with his altered mental status, this was concerning for hepatic encephalopathy.  On [**6-2**] the patient was started on lactulose for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy, then transitioned to rifaxamin on [**6-4**].  The patient was continued on his tacrolimus and cellcept.  He will follow up in [**Month/Day (4) **] clinic, where he will be assessed for future liver biopsy.  He will require an INPATIENT stay for this biopsy so that he can bridged from coumadin to heparin prior to the procedure. . Pancytopenia: Patient has a longstanding history of pancytopenia.  WBC was 1.9 on admission and ranged from 1.5-3.1 over his hospital course. HCT was in the low 20s and required 1 transfusion of pRBCs. This is of uncertain origin, likely multifactorial [**12-29**] infection, medication (HIV, antibiotics, etc). In setting of increasing splenomegaly, we have considered a hem/onc process.  As per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**], this is already being worked up in the outpatient setting. . HIV: Stable, CD4 65, VL 120, immunosuppressed on anti-rejection medications.  No modifications were made to his HAART regimen (RiTONAvir, Raltegravir) and bactrim ppx. Lyrica (for HIV neuropathy) was held while in MICU, but restarted on the floors. . DM: Stable, continue insulin sliding scale. . Depression: Continued mirtazapine and lexapro. . BPH: Continue terazosin.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Pt's history and hospital course reviewed. Briefly, this is a 52M w/ h/o HIV who p/w 3 days of anuria and general malaise. He had been having diarrhea for the past 6 weeks and on presentation to the ED for his anuria, he was found to be hypotensive to 84/60 and in ARF with Cr 5.7 (baseline 1.0). He also complained of left-sided chest discomfort, a substernal pressure radiating across his chest that had been ongoing for 2-3 weeks. Sepsis protocol was initiated and RSC CVL was placed. BP improved to SBP of 100 with 4L IVF and IV heparin was started for troponin leak of 0.11. He was transferred to the MICU. . While in the MICU, the patient's ARF responded well to IVF, with his Cr decreasing to 1.8 on transfer to the floor. TnT decreased from 0.11 to 0.02. However, TTE showed a markedly dilated RV cavity and moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis consistent with RV pressure/volume overload. The patient's pretest probability for PE was considered high given his HIV status, chest pain, and TTE results, but a V/Q scan showed low probability. Given his post-test estimated probability of PE was 20%, he was continued on anticoagulation. Hct drop from 33.8 on admission to 26.1 after fluid resuscitation with guaiac positive stool, hypovolemia, likely demand ischemia, and h/o abnormal EGD raised strong suspicion for GIB, but his Hct returned to 33.3 by time of transfer to floor. His platelets dropped from 160 on admission to 97, and HIT antibody test was positive [**9-25**], so he was switched to argatroban. On the day of transfer, the pt spiked a low-grade temperature to 100.7. He was pan-cultured but no antibiotics were started as there was no clear infectious source.

[**9-23**] CXR: PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The right subclavian venous line is terminating in mid SVC. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits, and there is no consolidation or effusion. . [**9-23**] CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST. Dependent changes are seen at the lung bases. Allowing for limitations of a non-contrast study, the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and kidneys appear unremarkable. Again seen is a rounded hypodensity in the right adrenal likely representing adrenal adenoma, not significantly changed in appearance from prior study. Visualized portions of bowel appear unremarkable. There is no evidence of free air or free fluid within the abdomen. Scattered lymph nodes are seenthroughout the mesentery and retroperitoneum, however, none appear to meet CT criteria for pathological enlargement. . -CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid appear unremarkable. Air is seen within the bladder, likely secondary to Foley catheterization. No evidence of free air or free fluid within the pelvis. . -ECHO ([**5-8**]): EF 55% , no regional wall abnormaliites, mild pulmonary HTN. . -ECHO [**2192-9-24**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is minimal mitral regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. . [**2192-9-24**] LENIs: no DVT . [**2192-9-24**] V/Q scan: low probability for PE   Brief Hospital Course: This is a 52 y.o. HIV positive male ([**2192-9-11**]: CD4 72, VL>100,000) with a 6 week history of diarrhea and low-grade temp who was initially admitted to the MICU for hypotension and ARF, improved after volume resuscitation. . # Diarrhea. Likely the patient was hypotensive and in renal failure secondary to hypovolemia precipitating ARF. The patient had a small amount of outpatient work-up for this, negative to date, including: Stool C. Diff, culture and CMV viral load undetectable. The patient was given symptomatic treatment, including imodium and his diarrhea improved dramatically. He was unable to provide a stool sample while on the floor. The patient was given a prescription for an outpatient stool sample for repeat stool culture (including viral and bacterial), DFA for crytosporidium and giardia, ova & parasites, microsporidium. The GI team was consulted on  the patient. It was their recommendation that the patient have an infectious work-up. If negative and diarrhea persists, the patient should have a colonoscopy at a later date when aspirin and plavix can be held (at least 9 months from the time of drug eluting stent placement. At the time of discharge, the patient's diarrhea was well-controlled with loperamide and the patient was tolerating fluids PO. He was encouraged to have aggressive PO fluid intake whenever diarrhea occurs. . # Fevers. The patient had a low-grade (100) fever after coming to the floor from the MICU. This may be secondary to the same process as the diarrhea. However, the patient has poorly controlled HIV and therefore is at risk for numerous sources. Empiric antibiotics were deferred as no source of infection was found. . # Hypotension. Likely secondary to persistent diarrhea. The patient was aggressively hydrated with IV NS in the MICU. He came to the floor normotensive and maintained this volume status for the remainder of his time in the hospital. . # Acute renal failure. Likely pre-renal secondary to persistent diarrhea and volume depletion. The patient's Cr improved to normal range after volume resuscitation. . # Chest pain. The patient had a CTA that was negative for PE. He had a slight troponin elevation thought consistent with demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension and poor troponin excretion in the setting of renal failure. The patient's troponin trended downward throughout his admission and he never showed CK elevations. . # CAD. No signs of acute ischemia. Troponin leak with normal CK likely secondary to demand ischemia and ARF. The patient was continued on ASA, plavix, beta blocker, statin. His ACEi was held for renal failure and then restarted prior to discharge. On echo, the patient had new mechanical dysfunction. The patient should have outpatient p-MIBI to assess for perfusion deficits. . # HIV. On [**2192-9-11**], CD4 72, VL>100,000. The patient's HAART has been held while in the MICU for renal failure. These medications were restarted prior to discharge. The patient's PCP will consider initiating prophylactic antibiotics as an outpatient. . # Anemia. Patient's baseline appears 29-30. Patient with drop in Hct likely in part secondary to dilution. The patient had guaiac positive stool with known abnormal colonoscopy and EGD in past is concerning for GI bleed. The patient had multiple units of blood transfusion while in the MICU. His Hct normalized prior to discharge. . # Thrombocytopenia. The patient's platelets declined to 90 while in the MICU and he was found to be HIT antibody positive. Heparin products were held and the patient's platelet count stabilized.

subsequently developed heparin induced thrombocytopenia with a large right iliofemoral DVT and over the past 3 days. Progressive signs of phlegmasia cerulea dolens. Despite aggressive anticoagulation with direct thrombin inhibitors and elevation, the toes were progressively gangrenous and venous thrombectomy was required to prevent limb loss. She was not a candidate for thrombolysis, due to her recent knee replacement.  Patient was admitted and placed on argatroban for anticoagulation and diltiazem.  Patient was transfused 2units x2 for low hct. Patient was taken to the OR venous thrombectomy to salvage limb.  In the OR the patient was found to have a patent left iliac venous system and patent inferior vena cava. Uneventful deployment of a Tulip IVC filter. Successful thrombectomy of the femoral vein of the thigh and profunda veins along with large amount of thrombus removed from the right iliac system. The resultant clearing was quite good. AV fistula was placed from the branch of the anterior saphenous vein to the superficial femoral artery.  Patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred in stable condition to CVICU intubated and given argatatroban.  POD1: swelling on right leg was much improved. Patient was extubated. SW was consulted and saw the patient several times for emotional suppor and to help cope with her illness.   Patient was continued tx of vanco/flagyl for prophylaxis.  POD2:  Physical therapy cleared for rehab.  POD3:  Patient was started on coumadin anticoagulation. Was encouraged to be OOB for short periods.  Physical therapy was c/s for dx & tx.  POD4: psychiatry was consulted for assessment and management of anxiety. Pt was assessed with dx c/w adjustment d/o with mixed anxiety/depression and recommended ativan 0.5mg PO TID PRN anxiety.  Psychiatry continued to follow during her stay.  POD5:  Argatroban was stopped (PTT was 102.0 and INR was 5.1) and INR checked four hours later to allow the effects of argatroban to wear off (PTT90.8, INR4.9 at that time).  Due to therapeutic INR,  argatroban remained off and patient was anticoagulated with coumadin only with target INR [**3-1**]. Silvadine was applied to right foot wound. And activity was increased to touchdown weight bearing of right heel.  POD6:  INR 3.7 and PTT 45.9  and coumadin 7.5mg given and PTT/INR cont to followed.

112446,"Admission Date: [**2197-9-16**]        Discharge Date: [**2197-12-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2197-9-16**]        Sex:  M  Service:  Neonatology   HISTORY:  Baby boy [**Known lastname 68869**], twin No. 1, was born weighing 718 grams, the product of a 24 and 6/7 weeks gestation pregnancy. He was born to a 34-year-old G2, P0, now 2 mother. Maternal history was notable for short cervix with cerclage placement prenatally.  Prenatal screens - blood type O positive, antibody negative, HbSAg negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune, GBS unknown. This infant was born by cesarean section after unstoppable preterm labor. The infant emerged with a weak cry, was brought to the warmer, given some positive pressure ventilation and intubated in the delivery room.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Anterior fontanel open and flat. Coarse breath sounds bilaterally with good breaths bilaterally. Positive red reflexes bilaterally.  No murmur. normal S1S2.  Normal pulses.  Soft, nondistended, no masses. Moved all extremities equally. Pink and well perfused.  Three-vessel cord, patent anus.  SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  RESPIRATORY: The infant had respiratory distress syndrome on admission to the NICU and was intubated and received surfactant therapy x2. He remained ventilated with conventional ventilation until [**2197-10-11**], which is day of life 25 when he required high frequency ventilation at that time for sepsis issues. Within 24 hours he returned to conventional ventilation. In the setting of his chronic lung disease, he was started on Lasix on DOL #42 ([**10-28**]), receiving Lasix every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. He extubated to CPAP on [**2197-11-7**], day of life 52, successfully weaned to nasal cannula on [**2197-11-27**], which is day of life 73. He weaned to room air on [**2197-12-17**], and has remained stable on room air since that time. He has had no apnea or bradycardia issues for well over a week. He was given caffeine citrate from [**2197-11-19**], through till [**2197-10-17**], at which time caffeine was discontinued due to increased heart rate. Caffeine was never restarted thereafter.  Currently, he is receiving Lasix every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  He had been receiving KCl as well but this was discontinued on [**12-20**] and his most recent Cl on [**12-26**] was 106 with a K of 5.5.  The infant will be followed for chronic lung disease by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37305**] at [**Hospital3 1810**] and has a follow- up appointment on [**1-5**].  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The infant presented with symptoms of PDA on [**2197-9-17**], at which time indomethacin was given.  A post-indomethacin echocardiogram on [**2197-9-19**] showed that that the ductus was closed. Followup echocardiogram was done on [**2197-10-3**], due to re-presentation, which showed a small 1 mm PDA. No indomethacin was given at that time. Two further echocardiograms have been done, both in [**Month (only) 359**] (23 and 26th) due to persistent murmurs. Both of those showed a very tiny PDA, neither of which was treated with Indocin. The infant has been hemodynamically stable and at this time does not have a murmur and has normal heart rate and blood pressure. No further issues.  He does not have a murmur at the time of discharge.  The infant did present with a brief period of supraventricular tachycardia on [**2197-10-17**], at which time caffeine citrate was discontinued and no urther episodes have been observed.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION: IV fluids were initiated on admission to the NICU and changed to total parental nutrition over the next few days. An umbilical arterial catheter was placed and a double lumen umbilical venous line was also placed on admission. The infant was started on enteral feedings on [**2197-9-21**], with a slow feeding advance and achieved full enteral feedings. A PICC line was placed on [**2197-9-23**]. The double lumen UVC was discontinued at that time. Enteral feedings were advanced and the infant achieved full enteral feedings by [**2197-9-30**]. Enteral feedings were then further concentrated to caloric density of breast milk 30 calorie per ounce with Beneprotein.  The infant had an episode of abdominal distention with an abnormal KUB and was treated for 14 days for medical necrotizing enterocolitis which was started on [**2197-10-10**]. The KUB subsequently normalized and the infant was restarted on enteral feedings on [**2197-10-27**]. Feedings advanced without an incident.  Currently, he is feeding PO ad lib of 26 calorie breast milk mixed as breast milk with 4 calories of Similac powder per ounce and 2 calories of corn oil per ounce. The infant's most recent weight is 2810 grams. He is gaining well. He is taking approximately 3 ounces every 4 hours enterally. Most recent set of electrolytes were done on [**2197-12-26**], and the results are Na=138, K=5.5, Cl=106, HCO3=23. His most recent head circumference is 34 cm, most recent length is 48 cm, both done on [**2197-12-26**]; at present he is 10 to 25th percentile for weight, 50 to 75th percentile for head circumference, and 25th to 50th percentile for length. He is on daily multivitamins, 1 ml per day.  Renal: On [**2197-12-26**], renal ultrasound was performed which showed bilateral calcifications in both kidneys, consistent with chronic lasix use.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The infant did have a period of medical necrotizing enterocolitis that was discussed under fluid, electrolytes and nutrition as above, treatment from [**2197-10-10**], through [**2197-10-27**]. The infant did have hyperbilirubinemia with a peak bilirubin level of 3.8/ 0.3 and did receive a total of 8 days of phototherapy.  HEMATOLOGY: The patient's blood type is A positive, DAT negative. The infant has received numerous blood product transfusions, and in total has received 5 transfusions of packed red blood cells with the most recent transfusion being on [**2197-10-28**]. The infant is on elemental iron, ferrous sulfate at 0.5 ml PO daily. Most recent hematocrit was 36 on [**2197-12-12**], with a reticulocyte count of 8.1%.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE: CBC and blood culture were screened on admission to the NICU. The infant had a white blood cell count of 5.1 with 29 polys, yielding an ANC of 1479. There was no left shift. The infant received 48 hours of ampicillin and gentamycin initially which were subsequently discontinued when the blood culture remained negative at that time. The infant had a sepsis evaluation done on [**2197-9-29**], at 13 days of life due to clinical instability. CBC at that time was normal but the blood culture grew staph epidermidis bacteremia. The infant was started on vancomycin and gentamycin and given a 7-day course of antibiotics at that time. At the end of that course of antibiotics, the infant presented with medical necrotizing enterocolitis and that was on [**2197-10-10**]. The antibiotic therapy was switched to Zosyn to treat for medical necrotizing enterocolitis at that time. The infant received 12 days of Zosyn therapy which was changed on [**2197-10-21**], to vancomycin, gentamycin and clindamycin when a blood culture grew positive at that time for gram positive cocci. CBC at that time was not shifted on [**2197-10-10**]. The infant received an additional 7 days of antibiotics which were subsequently discontinued on [**2197-10-27**]. The infant had a yeast diaper rash and was treated with miconazole powder from [**2197-10-21**], through till [**2197-10-29**]. There have been no further infectious disease issues.  NEUROLOGY: The infant has had numerous cranial ultrasounds done on [**2197-9-18**], [**2197-9-25**], [**2197-10-16**], [**2197-12-21**], all within normal limits.  SENSORY: Hearing screen was performed and the infant passed in both ears.  OPHTHALMOLOGY: The infant has had numerous ophthalmological examinations. The initial examination was done on [**2197-10-30**], and the most recent ophthalmologic examination was [**2197-10-26**]. The infant did have mild ROP but has progressed to mature eyes on [**2197-10-26**], and the plan is for follow up with ophthalmology in 9 months after discharge.  PSYCHOSOCIAL: [**Hospital1 18**] social worker has been involved with the family. If there are any concerns, she can be reached at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 56048**].  CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

Associated large veins are suggestive of a vascular malformation. If the hematoma is intradural, a spinal cord arteriovenous malformation is likely. A conventional angiogram is recommended for assessment of vascular malformation. Follow-up lumbar spine MRI is also recommended to evaluate the surgical decompression.  MRI L-Spine [**2133-6-13**]: IMPRESSION: Status post decompression of a large dorsal epidural hematoma, there is soft tissue swelling which continues to impress the distal cord and proximal cauda equina.  CXR [**2133-6-15**]: IMPRESSION: 1. Pacing leads in the expected position of the right ventricle. No evidence of pneumothorax. 2.

Preserved biventricular systolic function. Pulmonary artery hypertension.  PM Interrogation [**2133-6-24**]: PM functioning properly   Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo Cantonese F with history of Atrial fibrillation, Mitral valve replacement presented with epidural hematoma and lower extremity weakness. Patient is s/p epidural hematoma evacuation on [**2133-6-12**] and s/p single wire pacer placement on [**2133-6-14**] sceondary to periop brady/pause. Patient was found to have NSVT/?junctional tachycardia likely secondary to digoxin toxicity. . The patient p/w spontaneous epidural hematoma and LE weakness on [**2133-6-12**]. Following diagnositic evaluation, the patient was taken to surgery for a T12-L2 laminectomy and subsequent evacuation of the hematoma. At the time of admission the patient's INR was 3.5 as she was taking 3.5mg coumadin PO Qhs for prophylactic anticoagulation due to her h/o afib and MVR. Her coumadin was held and her INR monitored following surgery. She was placed on coumadin 3.0mg Qhs once her INR dropped below 2.0 and she was bridged with a heparin drip. Coumadin was increased to 4.0mg on [**2133-6-17**] and as her INR rose to 2.8 on [**6-22**], decreased to 3.0mg. Subsequent to her INR dropping from 2.5 to 2.1 on [**6-25**] and then to 1.9 on [**6-26**] the coumadin dose was increased to 4.0mg and 5.0mg repectively. Coumadin continued to be titrated to a dose of 3.5mg (her dose PTA) giving an INR of 2.4 at discharge.  In the perioperative period the patient began having episodes of bradycardia and pauses for which a single wire pacemaker was placed on [**2133-6-14**], with confirmation of proper lead placement by CXR. The PM was interrogated on [**2133-6-24**] and found to be functioning properly. Additionally in this time she developed mild anemia likely due to the spontaneous hematoma and surgical blood loss for which she received a total of 2 units of PRBCs and has since resolved.  During this time the patient was continued on Lanoxin for her atrial fibrillation and developed a NSVT/? junctional tachycardia likely due to digoxin toxicity. Her digoxin was discontinued and per EP's recommendations was not restarted and will be held indefinitely. In order to maintain K levels above 4.0 to avoid potential dysrhytmias from hypokalemia, spironolactone 25mg PO daily was started. On this regimen the patient required 40mEq of KCl PO daily to maintain her K levels and this was reduced to 20mEq daily as the K level on the day prior to discharge was 4.5. On discharge the K level was 4.3.  For heartrate control metoprolol was increased over time to an eventual dose of 75mg PO BID the day prior to discharge, during which time the patient's BP was stable at SBP=110s to 130s. On the day of discharge metoprolol 75mg [**Hospital1 **] was increased to Toprol XL 200mg to help control SBP that were in the upper 120s.  Following evacuation of her epidural hematoma she developed right LE pain, which was attributed to a radiculpathy and was successfully treated with Neurontin 100mg TID. Due to predominately left LE weakness, PT was consulted and recommended that the pt be discharged to an extended care factility where she could receive further care from PT. The patient continued to improve during the course of her stay, but was it was still considered necessary that the pt receive rehab upon d/c. Prior to discharge the patient was prescribed an AFO left foot splint.  In addition she spiked a temperature to 100.3, for which an infection work-up was began. Urine Cx showed Proteus Mirabilis, Bld Cx negative. She was treated impirically on Vacnomycin, which was d/c after the Bld Cx came back negative, and Ciprofloxacin. P. mirabilis was found to be intermediately sensitive to ciprofloxacin and Tx was switched to a sensitive antibiotic, Ceftriaxone 500mg po Q12H for 10 days. Ceftriaxone was stopped on [**2133-6-29**] and the patient remained afebrile and asymptomatic. Both incisions healed well without current drainage, erythema, edema, or tenderness.  Lastly during her hospital course she developed some bladder irritation/spasms and hematuria likely due to foley catheter trauma. The catheter was d/c'ed and she was treated with Detrol for a couple of days.  She has since been asymmptomatic and without hematuria.

There is minimal sulcal effacement. There is no associated intracranial hemorrhage.  Elsewhere in the brain, there is no edema, hemorrhage, mass effect, or evidence of infarction. Ventricles and sulci are otherwise normal in size and configuration for the patient's age. No fractures are identified. The right maxillary sinus is again atelectatic and completely opacified. Remaining paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated. The configuration of the calvarium is again unusual, with thinning of the posterior calvarium bilaterally, with a congenital appearance. CT PERFUSION: The perfusion maps demonstrate an extensive region of prolonged transit time and reduced blood flow and blood volume throughout the right MCA distribution, compatible with infarct. There is no mismatch to indicate a penumbra. HEAD AND NECK CTA: There is an abrupt cutoff of the superior division of the right M2 segment of the right middle cerebral artery. The inferior division arises early from the M1 segment on the right. There is a relative paucity of distal opacification within the MCA territory on the right. However, a few opacified vessels are present, the result of collateral flow. The remainder of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] is patent without other area of occlusion. The anterior communicating artery has a slightly bulbous appearance. The cervical carotid and vertebral arteries and major branches are patent with no high-grade stenoses. However, the entire right cervical ICA is slightly diminutive in caliber relative to the left, and slightly irregular suggesting a long segment of atherosclerosis. Both carotid bulbs demonstrate atheromatous irregularity without high-grade stenosis. There is atherosclerotic calcification of the cavernous carotids bilaterally as well. Lung apices demonstrate scarring and high-density material bilaterally, with bronchiectasis at the right lung apex. The aortic arch and origin of the major vessels demonstrate dense atherosclerotic calcification. The right internal carotid artery measures 8.3 mm at the bulb, 3 mm just above the bulb, and 3 mm at its upper portion. The left internal carotid artery measures 9 mm at the bulb, 5 mm just above the bulb, and 3.3 mm along the upper segment. IMPRESSIONS: 1. Large acute infarct in the right MCA distribution, with no perfusion mismatch. 2. Abrupt occlusion of the superior division of the right M2 segment of the right middle cerebral artery, with decreased filling of distal branches. Otherwise, patent circle of [**Location (un) 431**]. 3. Atheromatous irregularity at the carotid bulb bilaterally, with slightly diminutive right cervical ICA along its entire length, suggesting long segment atherosclerosis versus vasculitis. However, no high-grade stenosis of either side. 4. Slightly bulbous appearance of the anterior communicating artery. Please correlate with angiography. 5. Complete opacification and atelectasis of the right maxillary sinus as seen previously.  [**2148-1-11**] NCHCT: FINDINGS: Again noted is loss of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation in the right insula. Sulcal effacement and loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation extends to the right frontal and parietal lobes in a right MCA distribution. No evidence of acute hemorrhage is seen. There is some compression of the right lateral ventricle, not significantly changed from the prior examination. General prominence of the ventricles and sulci is compatible with generalized atrophy, age related. Areas of periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity likely reflect sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. No concerning osseous lesion is seen. There are vascular calcifications of the bilateral carotid siphons. Complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus is unchanged. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of acute hemorrhage. 2. Infarction in right MCA distribution as previously seen. No shift of midline structures.  [**2148-1-12**] NCHCT: FINDINGS: Again seen is a large right MCA territory infarct with expected evolution. There is no evidence of hemorrhage within the infarct. No significant mass effect or shift of midline structures is seen. The ventricles and sulci are mildly dilated, consistent with age-related involutional changes. The basal cisterns are normal. Calcification of the cavernous portion of bilateral carotid arteries is present. The mastoid air cells and imaged paranasal sinuses are clear. IMPRESSION: 1. Expected evolution of the large right MCA territory infarct. No significant mass effect or shift of midline structures is seen. 2. No evidence of hemorrhage within the infarct.   Brief Hospital Course: 86y F with atrial flutter and recently worsening dementia (undiagnosed), who was not taking anti-coagulation for her afib, recently s/p right Femur repair [**2147-12-20**]. Returned from Rehab to our ED as a code stroke due to Left-sided weakness, and was found to have a Right-M2 (superior division) occlusion, presumably due to cardioembolic clot given her aflutter without A/C. Given IV-tPA in the ED, with some improvement in her LUE (anti-gravity strength), but this was c/b a large and painful hematoma in the region of her recent surgery, which required that she go to OR urgently with Orthopedics for fasciotomy to relieve pressure from compartment syndrome (70mmHg pressure measured by Ortho). Her H&H dropped, but improved appopriately after transfusion of 2U PRBCs. Her family decided to stop pursuing aggressive care measures; fasciotomy and transfusion were performed due to their palliative value (pt. in severe pain from pressure/compartment syndrome). Pt was made CMO by family and transferred to the floor, with removal of tubes, lines, and invasive interventions and testing measures. She remained comfortable, but minimally responsive, with PRN sublingual morphine and with scopolamine patch. She died [**2147-1-16**].

Pertinent Results: CT head [**2200-2-17**]: FINDINGS: The study is compared with the initial NECT of [**2-14**] and the interval unenhanced and enhanced MR examinations of [**2200-2-15**]. Over the three-day interval, there has been little change in the overall appearance of the heterogeneous but predominantly hyperattenuating lobulated process centered in the extra-axial space of the left parietovertex. This appears to ""mold"" to the contour of the subjacent convexity, where there is focal low-attenuation in the immediate subcortical white matter, corresponding to the FLAIR-signal abnormality in this region, which may represent edema secondary to venous congestion, gliosis, or both. The overall appearance is most suggestive of a partially calcified en plaque meningioma, though there is no specific evidence of ""reactive change"" in the suprajacent inner table of the skull. There has been no other short-interval change.  IMPRESSION: No short-interval change in the overall appearance, with the lobulated, predominantly hyperdense, process, in the extra-axial space at the left parietovertex, given its stability and MR [**Date Range **] more likely an en plaque meningioma, partially calcified, accounting for the MR [**First Name (Titles) 16313**] [**Last Name (Titles) **].  Moreover, the findings on both this exam and the recent enhanced MR study raise the serious possibility of at least partial invasion of the immediately subjacent superior sagittal sinus, without definite thrombosis, and possible venous obstruction-related edema in local white matter. If this will affect therapeutic decision, dedicated MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] venography might be considered.   MRI Brain [**2200-2-15**]: FINDINGS: The study is significantly limited due to patient motion artifacts. There is enhancement noted in the area of known hemorrhage in the left parieto- occipital region, compared to the pre-contrast sequences done on the prior study. However, the etiology of enhancement is not clear as there is significant amount of hemorrhage in this location, as seen on the prior CT and MR studies. Mildly dilated ventricles are visualized, not adequately assessed.  IMPRESSION: 1. Study significantly limited due to motion artifacts. Enhancement noted in the left parieto-occipital region, partly extending along the dura, the etiology of which is uncertain, as this is in the region of the known hemorrhage. Repeat evaluation, after resolution of the hemorrhage can be considered, to evaluate for any underlying vascular or space-occupying lesion. Close followup with CT scan can also be considered as clinically indicated.    Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted on [**2200-2-14**] to the neurosurgery service after a mental status change at the nursing home. He was admitted with a presumed SDH on the CT scan. However, the patient had an MRI which revealed a mass resembling a meningioma. There was no hemorrhage there. The patient was transferred out of the ICU on [**2200-2-18**]. He was evaluated by PT and a speech/swallowing therapist. PT felt that he was safe to be discharged back the his nursing home on [**2200-2-19**]. On [**2-19**] he was also able to take in thin liquids and pureed solids without difficulty.  He had his foley catheter removed on [**2-18**] but had urinary retention. A Coud?????? catheter was placed that night and he was discharged with it in place. Flomax was started as well and bladder training was begun. He may be able to have it removed in a day or so at the nursing home. The patient should follow up with a urologist.  The patient was made DNR/DNI in the hospital by his health care proxy as well as for the ambulance ride. Palliative care and medical consults were obtained to assist in management of the patient. His medications were optimized due to his mental status changes. Additionally a family meeting with all 3 teams occurred. It was felt that surgery would not benefit the patient and that quality of life was important. We all agreed that being at the nursing home with his wife would be the best for him at this time. The nursing home staff may want to consider a ""Do not hospitalize"" policy with this patient and his health care proxy.

Right bundle-branch block. Left anterior fascicular block. Inferolateral lead ST-T wave changes are primary and non-specific. Since the previous tracing of [**2120-5-17**] inferolateral lead ST-T wave changes appear less prominent. . ECHO ([**6-18**]) PRE VALVE DEPLOYMENT The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe inferior, inferolateral, and inferoseptal hypokinesis. The remaining myocardial segments are mildly, globally depressed. The right ventricle displays mild global free wall hypokinesis. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-24**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is more significant calcification of the base of the posterior mitral leaflet and posterior mitral annulus. Mild to moderate ([**12-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. . POST VALVE DEPLOYMENT At initail deployment, the patient developed near cardiac arrest with right ventricular akinesis. The aortic valve was quickly replaced and epinephrine was given with resolution of right ventricular failure. The right ventriclular function then returned to the pre-deployment state. The mitral regurgitation was worsened and severe immediately after this event but after valve replacement returned to baseline (mild to moderate). The aortic valve and supporting structure is in situ. The leaflets can be seen moving. The maximum gradient across the valve was 7 mmHg with a mean of 4 mmHg. There is mild aortic regurgitation with two paravalvular jets seen. . ECG ([**6-18**]) Sinus rhythm with atrial sensed and ventricular paced rhythm. Since the previous tracing of the same date ventricular paced rhythm is now present. TRACING #2 . CXR ([**6-18**]) A CoreValve is in place. The left-sided pacemaker with the leads terminating at right atrium and right ventricle is noted. Lungs are essentially clear. Heart size and mediastinal silhouette are stable. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax noted. . ECHO ([**6-20**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to jypokinesis of the inferior septum, inferior free wall, and posterior wall. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall function. An aortic CoreValve prosthesis is present. A paravalvular aortic valve leak (trace-to-mild) is probably present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  . CXR ([**6-20**]) IMPRESSION: Very satisfactory postoperative situation. Permanent pacer with two intracavitary electrodes in unremarkable position. No pneumothorax identified. . ECHO ([**6-25**]) The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal inferoseptal, inferior, and inferolateral akinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. An aortic CoreValve prosthesis is present and appears well-seated. The transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen (probably paravalvular). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. . Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-6-20**], left ventricular systolic function appears similar. Left ventricular ejection fraction may have been slightly underestimated in the prior report. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher. Mitral regurgitation is now more prominent. Tricuspid regurgitation is now more prominent. . ECG ([**6-25**]) Ventricular paced rhythm at a rate of 80 beats per minute. No diagnostic change compared to previous tracing.   Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a [**Age over 90 **]yo M with a PMH significant for critical AS, CABG x4 and MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 82473**] for percutaneous aortic valve replacement with CoreValve device.  #1 Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis s/p CoreValve [**6-18**]: At initail deployment, the patient developed near cardiac arrest with right ventricular akinesis. The aortic valve was quickly replaced and epinephrine was given with resolution of right ventricular failure. The right ventriclular function then returned to the pre-deployment state. The mitral regurgitation was worsened and severe immediately after this event but after valve replacement returned to baseline (mild to moderate). Perioperative permanent pacemaker placed following occlusion of RCA, has right BBB and paced beats. ECHO shows good valve placement and mild perivalvular leak. One unit PRBC given post procedure for low hct. Pt will need aspirin and Plavix for a total of 3 months and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1022**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 32655**] NP for routine post procedure care. . #2 Complete Heart Block during CoreValve placement: common occurance in patients with right bundle branch block.

The patient also commented on associated malaise and diarrhea for two episodes.  The patient denied sick contacts, chest pain, did report receiving the flu vaccine this year and has no history of prior hospitalizations for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flares, pneumonias or any other pulmonary complications.  The patient denies recent travel, lower extremity trauma, calf pain or any other risk factors for pulmonary embolus.  Review of systems was otherwise negative.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1.  Hypertension. 2.  Fast heart rate. 3.  Increased cholesterol. 4.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy. 5.  Status post appendectomy. 6.  Emphysema without steroid or inhaler use.  ALLERGIES:  Penicillin, which produces a rash.  MEDICATIONS; 1.  Toprol 100. 2.  Lipitor 10 q.d. 3.  Cardura 2 q.d.  SOCIAL HISTORY:  Significant for greater then 100 pack years tobacco history.  Occasional ethanol use.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 101.8.  Heart rate 95.  Blood pressure 175/76.  Respiratory rate 23. Satting 88% on room air.  97% on 2 liters.  In general, alert and oriented times three, mild distress, shortness of breath with speech.  HEENT pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.  Bilateral injected sclera.  Flat JVP.  Lungs with diffuse rhonchi, expiratory wheeze and delayed expiration. Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm.  S1 and S2 with distant heart sounds.  Abdomen was soft, obese, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities were without clubbing, cyanosis or edema and were warm, dry and pink.  PERTINENT DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  Normal CBC with normal differential with white blood cell count.  Normal electrolytes.  Blood cultures that were sent remain negative. Chest x-ray with emphysematous changes without evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.  CT angiogram with diffuse emphysematous changes without evidence of infiltrate, effusion or pulmonary embolus.  Initial electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm without evidence of acute ischemic changes.  HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation:  The patient was initially admitted to the General Medical Service for a presumed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation in the setting of a upper respiratory infection with negative DFAs for influenza A and B.  Subsequently the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit and intubated for hypercapnic respiratory failure and was continually treated with Levofloxacin, steroids and nebulized Albuterol and Atrovent for this chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation with full ventilatory support. Several days into the Intensive Care Unit course bile cultures for influenza came back positive.  The patient completed a course of Levofloxacin and was briefly extubated for two to three days with recurrent respiratory failure, reintubated and eventually underwent tracheostomy.  On the day of discharge the patient's chest x-ray remained clear. The patient was afebrile and tolerating recurrent spontaneous breathing trials on trach mask with intermittent requirement of pressure support ventilation.  Sputum samples sent from the day of discharge revealed gram positive cocci without evidence of infiltrate on chest x-ray, evidence of a fever, stable white blood cell count and improved respiratory status.  2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient developed positive intubation hypotension and intermittently required pressures for support of his blood pressure throughout his Intensive Care Unit course.  The patient also developed rapid atrial fibrillation during his Emergency Department course that was initially treated with Diltiazem.  The patient was placed on Diltiazem drip and required intermittent boluses of Diltiazem throughout his Intensive Care Unit course.  After extubation the patient was switched to po Metoprolol of which he was maintained as an outpatient for his known history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia.  At the time of discharge the patient had been without pressers for several days and had his heart rate well controlled on b.i.d. Metoprolol.  The patient's outpatient cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1147**] was involved in the care of this patient on a day to day basis and frequently added input to the care of his supraventricular tachycardia.  3.  Gastrointestinal bleed:  After intubation and placement of a nasogastric tube the patient was noted to have evidence of an upper gastrointestinal bleed.  The Gastroenterology Service was consulted and performed an endoscopy and discovered events of trauma from the nasogastric tube that was thought to be the cause of this self limited upper gastrointestinal bleed while on anticoagulation for the paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  The patient was without evidence of gastrointestinal bleed throughout the remainder of his hospitalization.  4.  Hematuria:  During the patient's Intensive Care Unit course the patient developed gross hematuria in the setting of continuous indwelling Foley catheters.  This hematuria was associated with a brief drop in the patient's hematocrit, which required 2 units of packed red blood cells for transfusion.  After continuous bladder irrigation the hematuria resolved and the patient was without such findings throughout the remainder of his hospital course.  5.  Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was maintained on tube feeds throughout his Intensive Care Unit stay and received a percutaneous feeding tube placement and was tolerating tube feeds at goal at the time of discharge.  CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.  DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehab.  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1.  Respiratory failure. 2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. 3.  Influenza. 4.

History is limited by patient's non-verbal state and wife's limited English. Per wife, patient has been in the [**Name (NI) **] since [**5-22**] [**1-18**] CVA involving the right extremities. His mental status has been poor at baseline and has increasingly worsened to a non-verbal state approx one month ago. Beginning two nights ago, the patient was noted to have some respiratory distress, requiring oxygen and was started on Augmentin for a presumed PNA. However, his respiratory status did not improve and was noted to have a low-grade temp of 100.9, RR 30, HR 140, BP 155/88, SaO2 94% on supplemental O2 (unknown amount), prompting the NH to send the patient to the ED early this morning. . In the ED, he was noted to have a Tc of 103.8 (rectally), HR 134, BP 124/74, RR 42, SaO2 88%/NRB. His labs were notable for a WBC of 27.9 (97% N, no bands) and lactate of 2. He received combivent nebs, 1 gm tylenol pr, 500 cc of NS bolus, 1 gm ceftaz, 500 mg IV flagyl, and 1 gm of vanc. His sats improved while in the ED and he was weaned down to 4 L NC.

RENAL ULTRASOUND: The patient is status post right nephrectomy. The left kidney measures 13.4 cm. The calyces are mildly prominent throughout the left kidney, however, there is no frank evidence of hydronephrosis. No stones or masses are identified. The bladder is catheterized and empty. . Video Swallow: FINDINGS: Video oropharyngeal fluoroscopic swallowing evaluation was performed in conjunction with speech and swallow pathology. Patient was administered various consistencies of barium including thin, nectar, thick, and ground cookie. Posterior oral transit was moderately delayed. In addition, swallowing initiation was severely impaired with significantly delayed swallowing initiation to large boluses. When swallow was initiated, there was some adequate epiglottic deflection, and laryngeal valve closure. However, there was silent aspiration to thin liquids. The patient had difficulties following commands during the examination, and would not take cookie or straw. IMPRESSION: Severe swallow initiation delay with aspiration to thins. For further details, please consult the speech and swallow pathology note. . CT Head: CLINICAL INDICATION: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma with somnolence, assess for intracranial hemorrhage. There is a large hyperdense lesion involving the left frontal lobe near the convexity measuring 4.2 x 4 cm and surrounded by vasogenic edema, with mass effect seen over the left lateral ventricle. There is minimal midline shift to the right. The edema extends inferiorly into the left frontoparietal white matter and the left temporal lobe. The ventricular system is not dilated. There is no intraparenchymal or subdural hemorrhage. The fourth ventricle remains in the midline. There is heterogeneous hyperdense lesion abutting the right frontal aspect of the calvarium along the midline. This could represent volume averaging. No lytic lesions are identified. Chronic mucosal thickening is seen within the paranasal sinuses. . IMPRESSION: 4-cm hyperdense necrotic mass lesion involving the left frontal lobe surrounded by significant vasogenic edema and associated with sulcal effacement and surrounding mass effect as noted above. This is most likely metastatic in nature given the history of renal cell cancer. No intraparenchymal hemorrhage was seen. . CT Chest: Multidetector CT of the chest was performed without intravenous or oral contrast administration. Images are presented for display in the axial plane at both 5-mm and 1.25-mm collimation. . There is near complete opacification of the remaining portion of the left lung with only a small amount of residual aerated lung at the apical portion. Assessment of the central airways demonstrates complete obstruction of the left main bronchus just beyond its origin. The contents within the obstructed bronchus range from fluid to soft tissue attenuation. Superiorly, there are some areas of consolidation and ground-glass superimposed upon underlying areas of emphysema, but beginning in the mid portion of the left lung, opacified lung is relatively homogeneous without air bronchograms. An area of curvilinear calcification is present in the lower left hemithorax posteriorly and there are surgical clips present in the paraaortic and perihilar regions. . The left lobe of the thyroid gland is markedly enlarged and heterogeneous. The superior portion of the enlarged lobe is not completely imaged on this scan, and it is difficult to exclude adjacent areas of lymphadenopathy in the left neck as well. The enlarged thyroid gland results in rightward displacement and coronal narrowing of the trachea which is narrowed to approximately 8 mm at the thoracic inlet level. There is bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy on both sides of midline, with the right paratracheal lymph node measuring up to 3.6 x 2.7 cm and a left prevascular node measuring up to 2.5 x 3.0 cm. A bulky left lower paratracheal lymph node measures 3.1 x 2.0 cm. The left hilum is difficult to assess without intravenous contrast but there is probable left hilar lymphadenopathy as well. . There is left-sided pleural thickening contiguous with the area of homogeneous opacification in the left lower lung region. This is contiguous with an area of chest wall destruction involving a lower left lateral rib which is partially destroyed by the mass. Enlarged nodes are also present in the lower left paraaortic region and in the left extrapleural space. . Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, there are bulky lymph node masses which are incompletely imaged on this study. These are in the region of the celiac axis anterior to the aorta, measuring up to approximately 5.5 and 6.4 cm in greatest dimension. A left anterior peridiaphragmatic enlarged node is present as well as left retroperitoneal node enlargement. The adrenal glands are incompletely imaged on this study. Calcified gallstone is observed within the gallbladder. No definite lesions are seen within the liver but lack of intravenous contrast limits assessment. . As noted, the trachea is compressed and displaced by the thyroid mass. Fluid level within the intrathoracic trachea is probably due to retained secretions. Within the right lung, there are several small pulmonary nodules present, some of which are well circumscribed, and others of which are more poorly defined. The largest individual nodule is a poorly defined lateral segment right middle lobe nodule measuring 10 mm on image 31 of series 3. Respiratory motion limits assessment of the right lower lobe and right middle lobe. . Skeletal structures reveal partial destruction of the left seventh lateral rib as described above. Post-thoracotomy changes are present just above this level. Healed lower right anterior rib fractures are noted without definite associated lytic lesions. . Finally, incidental note is made of a calcified granuloma in the periphery of the right middle lobe.  IMPRESSION: 1. Complete obstruction left main bronchus. Although possibly due to retained secretions, obstructing endobronchial lesion is likely in this patient with history of renal cell carcinoma. Correlative bronchoscopy would be helpful. 2. Postobstructive collapse/consolidation in left upper lobe (status post left lower lobectomy). Associated soft tissue mass with dystrophic calcifications, contiguous or adjacent to chest wall mass with destruction of the left lateral seventh rib. 3. Bulky mediastinal and upper abdominal lymphadenopathy consistent with metastatic disease. Dedicated contrast-enhanced CT torso could be considered to more completely characterize the extent of metastatic disease if warranted clinically. 4. Marked enlargement of left lobe of thyroid gland with displacement and compression of trachea. It is difficult to exclude adjacent lymphadenopathy in the left neck. 5. Left-sided pleural thickening and small amount of pleural fluid. 6. Scattered nodules in the right lung, some of which are well defined and likely reflect metastatic foci and others of which are poorly defined and likely are related to the infection. .   Brief Hospital Course: Hospital course, by Problem:  #Respiratory Distress:  initially thought to be d/t aspiration PNA.  Was intially treated with broad spectum abx (Vanc, CTX, Flagyl).  Blood and Urine Cx negative but sputum did grow MRSA. To sort out whether the patient simply had aspiration pnuemonitis vs PNA, a CT scan of the chest was obtained.  This showed almost complete collapse of the remaining portion of his left lung from a L mainstem bronchus lesion, concerning for metastatic disease.  It also showed narrowing of the trachea to approx 8 mm from an enlarged left lobe of the thyroid, which is stable in size according to his outside oncologists.  Because of renal failure (see below), the patient was switched to Linezolid to cover MRSA; CTX/Flagyl were continued to cover for ? post-obstructive process. He will complete a today of a 10 day course of antitiotics to end on [**9-15**]. . #Acute Renal Failure:  during his hosptial course, his Cr rose from a baseline of 0.3-0.4 to a peak of 2.2.  Renal U/S negative.  Urine indicies not c/w pre-renal state, Urine Eos neagtive.  Renal team consulted; felt to be secondary to ATN, most likely from vancomycin.  Cr now starting to improve (2.0 on day of discharge). . #Cerebral Mets:  on CT scan, there was noted to me marked vasogenic edmema.  The patients DMS was increased to 4 mg IV q 8 hours and should be continued indefinatley as the patient appears to be more awake when on the higher dose.  They can be decreased should the patient develop agitation. . #ONC issues/goals of care:  after the Left mainstem lesion was discovered, both interventional pulmonary team and radiation team were consulted.  Both felt that bronchoscopy and radition therapy would add little to his quality/quantity of life, given his extremely poor performance status and prognosis.  His wife was in agreement that he should not receive any invasive procedures in the future.  She understood that should the patient develop subsequent respiratory distress, she should not be brought back to the hospital but should be given morphine and ativan for comfort. . #Anemia:  high ferrtin c/w Anemia of Chronic Disease.  Stable. . #FEN:  the patient had speech/swallow evaluation which showed moderate-severe oropharyngeal dysphagia characterized by reduced bolus control and formation as well as a significant pharyngeal swallow initiation delay with mild silent aspiration of thin liquids.   The speech/swallow team recommended Nectar thick liquids and pureed solids, PO meds crushed in purees, along with 1:1 assistance for meals, strict aspiration precautions.

There is stable epidural disease.  There have been posterior laminectomies and there is no spinal cord compression, although there is probably some myelomalacia and atrophy at the level of the surgery, unchanged. * L Shoulder/humerus Plain film: Read pending; no obvious fracture, ? metastatic involvement. . CXR [**1-22**]: Patchy opacities most prominent in the right lower lobe, worrisome for pneumonia. . CT spine [**1-23**]: Progression of the lytic osseous and epidural metastases, with progressed malalignment. Fracture through the T2 pedicle screws bilaterally . CTA [**1-23**]: 1) Right lower and right middle lobe air space consolidation consistent with pneumonia. There appears to be narrowing of the bronchus intermedius. 2) Left lower lobe atelectasis and patchy multifocal bilateral generalized foci of air space disease most likely reflecting consolidations though metastases are not excluded. 3) Progression of osseous vertebral and hepatic metastasis. 4) No evidence of PE. 5) Possible cervical instability. . Bone scan [**1-23**]:  1) No abnormal uptake in the left upper extremity. 2) Uptakecorresponding to known metastases in the sternum, cervical spine as above. The new uptake in the left 11th and 12th rib ends likely post-traumatic.  Brief Hospital Course: 68M thyroid ca to bone + liver p/w increased pain L shoulder/ humerus.  Pt was admitted to the Medicine service and treated for the following problems: . # pneumonia: Patient had altered MS and low grade fevers [**1-22**] and CXR performed which suggested pna. Started on levo/flagyl with concern for aspiration. [**1-23**], patient had new hypoxia and hemoptysis. Hematocrit has remained stable. CTA negative for PE but did confirm significant pneumonia.  No fevers since starting levo/flagyl. . #L shoulder/humerus pain: Evaluated by radiation oncology who felt that risks of radiation in setting of multiple prior episodes was quite high especially given instability. Neurosurgery consulted for cervical spine.  His pain was initially difficult to control, but was ultimately dramatically improved when he was changed to a dilaudid PCA--he did not have relief from fentanyl patch, likely b/c of soft tissue wasting and future efforts at long acting medications should be PO. . #thyroid ca, metastatic disease:  progressive in spine and likely contributing to current complaints.  Levothyroxine was continued. consider neupogen. Will d/w attending Oncologist . # thrush: The patient was admitted with thrush which was succesfully treated with nystatin S&S.  Neurosurgery team asked to eval this pt on [**2153-1-23**]  and was transferred to our service for spinal deformity which was noted on upper level of images (CT chest) to r/o PE.  CT of cervical thoracic spine was obtained and results of T1 collapse noted. Pts family, at that time wanted to continue care with prior Neurosurgeon/Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**].  This was communicated to this neurosurgery team.  Some short time later the family wished against transfer out to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1334**] care and decided that they would want surgery to correct spinal deformity/kyphosis here. The pt was placed in [**Last Name (un) 20482**] Halo traction at 30lbs of traction. This was in attempt to reduce kyphotic deformity for pre-operative optimization.  A CT scan of the spine was obtained in traction and good reduction of the deformity was noted.  The pt was then medically optimized and pre-op'd and taken to the OR on [**2153-2-8**] for C7 T1 T2 corpectomies/ anterior approach. There was a lot of bleeding during the initial anterior approach / the case lasting approximately 7 hours.  It was decided that the pt would remain intubated and return to the OR on the 5th (the next day for continuation of the case.  The second portion of the case was completed that day (the 5th).  Thoracic surgery assisted because of mediastinal mass / we needed sternotomy to control bleeding and complete ant. approach. The total EBL was 7.5 liters with the pt being given 22 units of PRBC's.  He had a chest tube placed on the left side intraoperatively.  This was removed on approx 1/7/7.  Postoperatively he was started on Fondiparinox on [**2-13**] as he is HIT positive. On [**2153-2-14**] he had a peg tube place. His postoperative  head CT and spine CT's were stable.  His neurological status postoperatively was stable. All extremeties are antigravity and his mentation is intact.  His course complicated by intermittent low HCT's for which he was transfused.  Temps as high as 102.+ for which he was started on Zosyn. On [**2153-2-16**] his left upper extremity was noted to be swollen and son[**Name (NI) **] noted LUE DVT.  On the 14th, the halo ring that was initially placed for use of cervical traction and for potential halo vest placement was removed.  He remains in a cervical collar and had been OOB to chair.  The patient required prolonged ventilation he had difficulty clearing his secretions. His family was offered a trach but they felt the patient had a difficult post operative course and was suffering they did not want to the patient to under go further procedures.  The patient had made his wishes clear to his family not to be dependent or on a ventilator for a prolonged period.  After a long discussion with the family and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] they decided to extubate the patient and see if he could tolerate being extubated, he quickly passed away in a few minutes with his family at his side.

[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]  GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.   Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (EF 35-40%). Due to the suboptimal image quality, a regional wall motion abnormality cannot be excluded. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.  IMPRESSION: Small echodense pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Mild aortic regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-10-3**], the pericardial effusion is smaller. The other findings are similar.  Electronically signed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 171**], MD on [**2137-10-10**] 14:51.  MRA head IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of orbital abnormality on limited sections through the orbits.  2. Evidence of atherosclerotic disease, but without marked stenoses or occlusion among the major arteries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**]. Because of the limitations of the study, the ophthalmic arteries are not well visualized on either side.  3. Multiple small foci of T2 hyperintensity suggestive of prior tiny infarcts in the cerebral white matte bilaterally. A few of these demonstrate faintly increased signal also on diffusion-weighted imaging, suggesting that they may be either subacute or chronic.   Brief Hospital Course: Transferred in from OSH and underwent cardiac catherization that resulted in intra aortic balloon pump placement and transferred to operating room emergently [**9-19**].  Please see catherization report for further details.  He underwent coronary artery bypass graft x5, please see operative report for further details.  He was transferred to the CSRU on Neo and propofol with IABP.  He received FFP, protamine, and platlets for post operative bleeding, and then returned to operating room for reexploration, please see operative report for further details.  He was transferred to CSRU for continued management.  He continued with tachycardia not responsive to esmolol was changed to cardizem with better control, required vasopressors for hypotension.  On postoperative day [**1-16**] the IABP was weaned and removed, he continued on vasopressors, cardizem was discontinued and he was started on beta blockers.  He remained intubated due to hemodynamics and agitation.  Agitation continued with weaning of sedation, diuresed, and betablocker increased.  Postoperative day [**4-18**] tolerated CPAP and was extubated but was confused moving all extremeties. Blood pressure and heart rate labile, labetolol started.  Postoperative [**6-20**] he went into atrial fibrillation and treated with Amiodarone and beta blockers. He remained in the CSRU due to agitation on CIWA d/t ETOH withdrawal, hemodynamic, and respiratory management.  Psychiatry consulted due to continued delirium and medications adjusted.  Anticoagulation was started for atrial fibrillation with coumadin on POD [**11-25**]. On postoperative 14/13 he was ready for transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name **] 2 with a sitter, he continued with confusion at times, in/out atrial fibrillation.  He continued to progress and physical activity increased, he became more oriented, and was able to wean off ativan and sitter.  On posterative day 20/19 he complained of not being able to see out of left eye - opthamology evaluated with question of posterior ischemic optic neuropathy which is diagnosis by exclusion and he underwent MRI.  Plan for follow up with opthamology in clinic no medical intervention at this time. On postoperative day 21/20 creatinine elevated with decreased sodium. Fluid intake was increased, renal consulted, echocardiogram (EF 35-40%).  All diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and NSAID discontinued.  Creatinine decreased on Postoperative day 23/22 but sodium remained decreased and placed on free water restriction with plan for chemistry to be rechecked [**10-14**] at rehab.

The patient was recently admitted to the cardiothoracic service from [**2125-7-2**] - [**2125-7-26**] for worsening shortness of breath thought to be due to worsening AS, MR, and worsening heart failure (EF 40%). He was taken to the OR on [**7-3**] for aortic valve replacement with a St. Jude's valve, aortic endarterectomy, and MVR with a [**Company 1543**] mosaic tissue valve. His hospital course was complicated by hypotension requiring pressor support and eventual failure to extubate due to altered mental status/encephalopathy and inability to handle secretions. He received trach and PEG on [**2125-7-17**]. He also received 7 days of Vancomycin and Cefepime for the secretions (presumably for emperic treatment of VAP). Of note, he did have some delerium noted at night -- seroquel was attempted but discontinued due to somnolence. He was tolerated trach collar, PM valve, and tube feeds prior to discharge to [**Hospital6 1293**]. . His daughter reports that at baseline, he has baseline dementia but has some baseline cognitive function, including being alert, interactive, and talkative.  Of note, trach was also removed at rehab. However, his mental status at rehab has been waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] during his rehab stay (documented in multiple cardiothoracic NP[**MD Number(3) 29639**] as having confusion at rehab occasionally requiring restraints and wandering), but noted by his dtr to be worsening over the past week since he was transferred to a new [**Hospital1 1501**]. He has had episodes of jerking movements of his fingers or a 'kick' of the legs. Independently, he also has episodes of lethargy, where he falls ""asleep"" mid-sentence, is unresponsive to tactile or verbal stimuli, then returns to his baseline but appears drowsy/confused. These unresponsive episodes were occurring [**2-28**] times a day, but were also increasing in frequency during the week prior to admission. Haldol and Trazodone have been attempted at rehab without good effect and were discontinued due the drowsiness as well as (per ED report) some symptoms of lip smacking that were thought to be [**2-27**] tardive dyskinesia. He was originally discharged on tube feeds, but per report has been tolerating a PO diet. He was brought into the ED today for further evaluation of these symptoms. . In the ED, initial vs were: 98.5 90 130/102 18 99% on room air Patient was given ativan 2 mg IV x1, Vancomyin 1 gram IV x1, CFTX 2 grams IV x1, and Dexamethasone 10 mg IV x1. Labs significant for a WBC of 14.0, ALT of 41, AST of 47, INR of 3.8, and chemistries WNL. No formal ABG performed, but pH noted to be 7.40 at 4:46 PM. He was noted multiple times by the ED attendings and residents to have multiple (>3) lethargic episodes and multiple episodes of myoclonic jerks. The patient would be responsive afterwards, but somewhat confused per report, stating he was 'in Brookline'. He got 2 mg of Ativan for presumed seizure activity and became unresponsive with slight desaturation requiring BiPAP. Neurology was consulted in the ED and thought the patient was having myoclonic jerks/encephalopathy, but exam was clouded by recently receiving Ativan. Head CT with no acute intracranial process. CTA demonstrated no PE, LLL aspiration pneumonitis, and a stable AAA. He was initially going to be taken onto the neurology service, but due to concern for his unresponsiveness and possible respiratory compromise, he was admitted to the MICU for further monitoring.  His VS were afebrile 110 25 125/86 100% on NRB prior to transfer. . On the floor,  the patient is lethargic and minimally responsive to vocal or tactile stimuli.

ECG [**2125-9-12**]: Atrial fibrillation with a mean ventricular rate of 110. Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay. Left axis deviation with probable left ventricular hypertrophy. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2125-7-3**] multiple abnormalities as previously noted persist without major change. . CT Head w/o contrast [**2125-9-12**]: No acute intracranial process. Low-attenuating lesions in the periventricular white matter, most likely represent sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. . Chest CTA [**2125-9-12**]: 1. Bilateral pleural effusions with perifissural consolidation/atelectasis. Peribronchovascular thickening extending into the posterior segment to the left lower lobe is concerning for aspiration. 2. Stable ascending aortic aneurysm. Stable dilation of the aortic arch as well as the distal aspect of the thoracic aorta. 3. Cardiomegaly with biatrial enlargement. 4. No pulmonary embolism. . [**Month/Day/Year 5283**] US [**2125-9-13**]: 1. No evidence of cholecystitis or biliary obstruction. 2. Bilateral, right greater than left small pleural effusions. 3. Multiple bilateral renal cyst again seen. . TTE [**2125-9-14**]:The right atrium is moderately dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The prosthetic aortic valve leaflets appear normal The transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The prosthetic mitral valve leaflets are thickened. The transmitral gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen, but current study cannot exclude prosthetic valve endocarditis. Depressed left ventricular systolic function. . TEE [**2125-9-18**]: Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. LV systolic function appears depressed. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The prosthetic mitral leaflets appear normal. The transmitral gradient is normal for this prosthesis. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen. Normally-functioning bioprosthetic aortic and mitral valves.  Brief Hospital Course: 81yo male with history of rheumatic heart disease s/p St. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 1525**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1291**] and tissue MVR in [**6-/2125**], afib on coumadin, and systolic heart failure who presented to ED from rehab with lethargy/altered mental status.  #. Respiratory Failure: Patient developed acute hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to lorazepam administration in ED. He was transferred to ICU for further care, but did not require intubation. He has severe OSA, and was seen by sleep medicine while in ICU. Unable to complete study as patient could not tolerate BiPAP, but patient will need sleep medicine follow-up and repeat sleep study as outpatient.  The patient's respiratory status improved, and he was stable for transfer to the floor on [**2125-9-14**]. The patient was unable to tolerate CPAP, and therefore was kept on oxygen via nasal cannula at night.  He was not given any further sedating medications except in the setting of his TEE.  All sedating meds in the outpatient setting should be avoided or minimized as possible. . #. Enterococcal bacteremia: Blood cultures drawn on admission positive for enterococcus sensitive to vancomycin and ampicilin. He was initially on vancomycin, then switched to ampicillin/gentamicin per ID consult recommendations.  He required ampicillin desensitization in ICU setting given his h/o penicillin allergy. A TEE on [**2125-9-18**] did not reveal the presence of any valvular vegetations. However, per ID recs the patient should still complete a course of antibiotics that would treat endocarditis, especially given his [**Date Range 1291**]/MVR. CT surgery was following, and there was no need for surgical intervention given the TEE findings.  The patient will be on ampicillin until [**2125-10-28**], and gentamicin for synergy until [**2125-9-29**]. He had a PICC placed on [**2125-9-19**] for continued antibiotic therapy. All surveillance blood cultures drawn since [**2125-9-12**] were negative to date at time of discharge.  The patient remained afebrile and was hemodynamically stable. . #. Altered mental status: The patient was found to have enterococcal bacteremia, and delirium in setting of infection was likely the primary contributing factor to his altered mental status.  Also probable contributing factors include chronic CO2 retention, severe OSA, medication effects, and prolonged hospital course.  Head CT on admission did not show any acute intracranial process. No other source of infection, including PNA or UTI, was identified. At time of discharge, patient's mental status continued to wax and wane. He was oriented to person and place, and able to follow some commands. . #. s/p St. [**Initials (NamePattern4) 1525**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1291**] and tissue MVR: Given valves, goal INR is 2.5-3.5. The patient's INR was trended and coumadin dose was adjusted accordingly. Coumadin held for period in setting of supratherapeutic INR, then restarted. INR was also briefly subtherapeutic, and patient was placed on heparin gtt during this time to bridge back to a therapeutic INR on coumadin.  INR was at goal (2.5) on day of discharge, and heparin gtt had been stopped. INR should continue to be monitored, and coumadin dose adjusted accordinly. As above, no evidence of valvular vegetations was seen on TEE [**2125-9-18**]. . #. Atrial fibrillation: Patient's home dose of metoprolol was titrated up to 100mg PO TID, given frequent episodes of tachycardia to 120s. Patient was asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable during these episodes.  He was continued on coumadin as above for both his a fib and [**Month/Day/Year 1291**]/MVR. . #. Chronic systolic heart failure: TTE on [**2125-9-14**] showed LVEF of 30-35%. Patient appeared euvolemic for much of hospital course. He was on furosemide 20mg daily prior to admission, and this medication should be restarted in outpatient setting if patient develops hypervolemia and pulmonary edema. Patient was continued on ACE inhibitor and beta blocker. Lisinopril dose is currently 5mg daily, this can be up-titrated if BP will allow in outpatient setting. . #. Hypertension:  The patient was continued on metoprolol, lisinopril as above. Furosemide may be restarted as outpatient if patient develops hypervolemia or becomes more hypertensive. . #. Hyperlidipemia: The patient was on simvastatin 10mg daily prior to admission, and this was re-started prior to discharge. This medication was briefly held in setting of elevated transaminases, however was resumed as transaminases trended down to normal levels. Etiology of elevation in transaminases unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) 5283**] US on [**2125-9-13**] was unremarkable. . #. Nutrition: Patient has PEG tube in place, but has not been using since prior to admission. He is able to tolerate PO intake, but should be monitored on aspiration precautions.

The patient had a history of active NSAID use, and also uses Etoh socially. He was admitted to the MICU. He got 2 units PRBCs without Hct response to the first unit, but with good Hct response to the second unit. EGD showed non-bleeding antral ulcers and possible Barretts esophanus. The patient was stable with no further Hct drop, so he was transfered to the floor.  He was counseled to avoid all NSAIDs indefinently, unless told otherwise by GI in the future. GI saw the patient in house and will follow outpatient, with repeat EGD in [**6-18**] weeks to eval for healing of antral ulcers and possible esophagus biopsy. H pylori blood test was sent and was pending at time of discharge.  # CAD: s/p BMS placement in [**2185**]. No active signs of ischemia now, Troponins negative, EKG unchanged, no chest pain. Dizziness and diaphoresis likely [**2-11**] anemia from acute blood loss from GI bleed, and does not represent anginal equivalent at this time. ASA 325 was initially held on admission for acute GI bleed. On discussion with outpatient cardiologist, it was decided to decrease ASA to 81 daily. ASA was restarted the morning of discharge since it was felt that the patient was not actively bleeding.  # HTN - cont metoprolol, DCed lisinopril per outpatient cardiologist since BP well controlled without it and has normal LV function.  # HLD - cont atorvastatin  # BPH: no active issues  # PPX: pneumatic boots, bowel regimen  # CODE STATUS: Full, confirmed  # CONTACT: Wife [**Name (NI) 107117**] [**Name (NI) 107118**] home [**Telephone/Fax (1) 107119**] cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 107120**]  Transitional issues - F/U H pylori, which was pending at time of DC.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you were feeling lightheaded and had were not feeling well. Your symptoms were explained by a bleed in your stomach. The gastroenterologists performed an endoscopy which showed an ulcer in your stomach. This is likely related to the ibuprofen and naproxen use. It is very important that you avoid such medications in the future. You will need a follow up endoscopy in [**6-18**] weeks.  Also, at discharge there is a lab test (which tests if there is bacteria in your stomach causing the ulcers) that is still pending. We will arrive for someone to contact you with the results.

She was in her USOH until 3 days ago, when she developed insidious onset of nasal congestion, runny nose, and cough occasionally productive of scant yellow sputum.  She reports minor subjective fever initially that has resolved.  These symptoms have persisted until now.  Over the past 2 days, she has developed increased dyspnea on exertion. There is no dyspnea at rest, orthopnea, or PND.  This morning, she had a prolonged episode of coughing which caused significant dyspnea, prompting her to call her PCP for advice.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 665**] was concerned about her dyspnea and advised her to present to the ED for evaluation.  She denies any weight loss, chills, myalgias, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematochezia, black stools, dysuria, chest pain, or palpitations.  She does report difficulty w/ balance over past months requiring her to use a cane for walking. In the ED, she was observed to have a large melanic stool without any associated symptoms.  Vital signs were stable.  She was treated w/ ceftriaxone 1gm and azithromycin 500mg for possible PNA.  Past Medical History: 1. Pacemaker DDD for sick sinus syndrome 2. Thoracic aortic aneurysm s/p aortic arch graft and AVR 3. s/p AVR w/ St. Jude's valve [**2178**] 4. Hypertension 5. Hypothyroidism 6. Lower back pain 7. Colonic polyps 8. Iron deficiency anemia 9.

Probable emphysema.  CTA chest: 1. Slightly limited examination for evaluation for pulmonary embolus, although no large central pulmonary embolus is present and no definite evidence of more distal pulmonary embolus is visualized. 2. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, including multiple subcentimeter pretracheal and precarinal nodes, and enlarged right hilar and subcarinal nodal masses. 3. Four millimeter nodule within the left upper lobe laterally. Comparison with any possibly available prior imaging is recommended. Short-term CT follow-up is recommended. 4. Bronchiectatic changes predominantly in the lower lobes bilaterally. 5. Large hiatal hernia.  [**2188-2-22**]: Angiogram IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of active extravasation of the contrast material as above. 2. Embolization of the left L3 lumbar artery per surgical team request.   Brief Hospital Course: 1. Dyspnea:  she was admitted w/ dyspnea in setting of URI symptoms that was most consistent w/ viral URI, as there was no fever and no infiltrative process on chest CT.  She was tested for influenza w/ DFA of nasal aspirate.  Meanwhile, she was treated w/ ceftriaxone and azithromycin to cover possible CAP. On HD#2, DFA returned as positive for influenza A.  As the pt had been afebrile w/ no signs of infxn, pneumonia was thought to be unlikely and abx were d/c at that time.  She remained dyspnic w/ upper and lower airway wheezing throughout her early hospital course, which was thought to be [**2-6**] viral bronchitis.  She was treated w/ prednisone taper and nebulized albuterol and atrovent, w/ good symptom control.  However, she required continued O2 by NC to maintain O2 sats >93% throughout the first half of her admission.  By d/c, she was weaned off O2 and was breathing comfortably on room air without requirement for albuterol or atrovent.  At d/c, she is maintaining good O2 sat on room air and is not dyspnic.  2. GI bleed:  she was observed to have melanic stool in the ED, without any GI symptoms.  She was guaiac positive at that time. This was most likely [**2-6**] indolent upper GI bleed.  On admission, coumadin was held and heparin was started for anticoagulation given her AVR.  Treatment was started w/ IV protonix.  Plans were made for EGD/colonoscopy to evaluate for source of bleeding, but these procedures were delayed due to the pt's dyspnea and relative risk of sedation.  Her HCT was observed to drop significantly, which was likely [**2-6**] retroperitoneal bleed as below, and not related to GI bleed.  After her admission, she had no further melena or hematochezia.  After stabilization of retroperitoneal bleed, she underwent EGD and colonoscopy, which demonstrated evidence of esophagitis w/ no active bleeding. Protonix was changed to oral formulation, and sucralfate was added for improved treatment of esophagitis.  She had no further evidence of active GI bleeding during her admission.  Her sucralfate was stopped. She will need to continue protonix twice daily after d/c.  3. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage:  on HD#4, her HCT was observed to have dropped overnight from 27 to 21.  This was concerning for active GI bleed.  She was transfused w/ 2units PRBCs, w/ appropriate HCT increase to 29 after transfusion.  However, her HCT again decreased overnight from 29 to 22 with no melena or hematochezia to explain the blood loss.  Lab workup showed no evidence of hemolysis.  Abd CT demonstrated large left retroperitoneal hemorrhage, 11x5 cm in size, w/ radiographic evidence of acute on chronic bleeding.  Heparin was d/c, she was transfused w/ an additional 2units PRBCs, and was transferred to the MICU for close monitoring.  Surgery was consulted, and recommended holding anticoagulation with close monitoring of HCT.  The pt had appropriate response of HCT w/ PRBC transfusion, and HCT remained stable for 3 days off anticoagulation.  As HCT had stabilized, she was transferred back to the Medicine floor and Surgery recommended resuming heparin for anticoagulation.  Heparin was resumed w/ close monitoring of PTT, and HCT was monitored closely.  However, after resuming heparin the pt had another decrease in HCT concerning for active bleeding.  Heparin was stopped immediately.  Repeat CT scan showed enlarging left retroperitoneal bleed tracking down into pelvis and left thigh. CTA was done to localize source of bleed, and showed active contrast extravasation from the left L3 lumbar artery.  IR was consulted, and performed embolization of left L3 lumbar artery, though there was no evidence of active bleeding from the artery at the time of the procedure.  She tolerated the procedure well. HCT was follow closely after embolization, and remained stable for 3 days.  Repeat CTA showed no active bleeding from the L3 lumbar artery, which indicated a successful embolization.  Given this confirmation and stable HCT, heparin was resumed w/ initial goal PTT of 40.  HCT was stable on this level of heparin, so heparin was increased to goal PTT of 60-70.  The pt received 1 dose of coumadin 5mg to begin long-term anticoagulation.  A PTT of 60 was achieved and was stable for 12 hours w/ stable HCT, but the pt then developed abdominal distention and pain, w/ significant LLQ/LUQ tenderness on exam.  This was concerning for additional bleeding.  Heparin was once again d/c, and repeat CT showed markedly enlarged retroperitoneal bleed displacing the left kidney and bowels to the right abdomen.  Surgery, IR, and Vascular Surgery were all consulted for recommendations on how to stop her bleeding.  The consulting services all agreed that intervention was ill-advised, as surgical treatment was often inneffective and repeated arterial embolization in this setting might result in embolization of the wrong vessel, w/ possible bowel infarction or other complication.  Thus, the pt was given 2units FFP to reverse her INR of 1.3, and was transfused w/ 2units of PRBCs.  Her HCT did not respond appropriately to PRBC transfusion, so she was transferred to the MICU for close monitoring and continued transfusion.  While in MICU, anticoagulation continued to be held, and patient remained stable during MICU course.  Indeed, it was felt that risks of bleeding outweighed need to anti-coagulation benefits. The patient was transferred to the floor with no further episodes of bleeding and a stable hematocrit for >72 hours by discharge.  4. HTN:  BP was acceptable on admission.  BP meds were held initially given concern for GI bleed and subsequent retroperitoneal hemorrhage.  However, BP was elevated within a few days of admission.  When retroperitoneal bleed had initially stabilized, her outpt meds were resumed including diovan, HCTZ, and clonidine, resulting in good BP control.  When her hematocrit began to drop for a second time and the patient was transferred back to the MICU, her antihypertensives were again held. As her bleed stabilized, her blood pressures trended upward and she was restarted on diovan at 1/2 her home dose. Her blood pressures should be followed at rehab.  5. Anemia:  she has h/o iron deficiency anemia, w/ prior EGD showing gastritis.  HCT on admission was slightly below baseline of 32-33.  HCT remained stable for initial hospital days, but dropped w/ retroperitoneal bleed as above.  Her HCT was labile throughout her admission [**2-6**] intermittent bleeding. At d/c, there is no evidence of active bleeding.  She will require f/u of HCT after d/c to watch for further bleeding.  6. Hypothyroidism:  stable on synthroid during her admission.  7. AVR:  she has St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] artificial aortic valve; requires anticoagulation w/ goal INR 2.5-3.5.  INR subtherapeutic on admission.  Given melanic stool, we held coumadin on admission and started heparin for anticoagulation.  She had intermittent retroperitoneal bleeding during her admission, requiring d/c and resumption of heparin multiple times as above.  Given her repeated spontaneous bleeding after embolization of L3 lumber artery, we do not want to restart anticoagulation in the near future as the risk of ongoing bleeding is too great.  8. Mediastinal LAD:  she has mediastinal LAD, w/ largest node 3 x 2 cm by CT.  This may represent lung CA given pulm nodule and smoking history.  However, the pt wishes to defer further evaluation until active issues resolved.  Will follow w/ repeat CT 2 months after d/c.  9. Cystitis:  she developed cystitis from yeast while using foley catheter, likely [**2-6**] [**Female First Name (un) 564**], as supported by pyuria and yeast in ucx.  Foley catheter was changed on discovery of yeast in urine, and she was treated w/ 7 day course of fluconazole. At d/c, there is no evidence of active infection.

She had been discharged from [**Hospital1 **] following hospitalization from presumed sepsis and hypotension on [**2125-11-5**] to rehab. On the evening of [**11-9**] a moonlighter was called for increasing agitation. It is unclear at what point she  received 0.5mg of ativan. The patient was confused (oriented x1) with  a question of increasing tremor and possibly slurred speech and was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for concern of seizures v. sepsis with AMS. . In ED tachy to 110s, SBP 110s and required a  0.7L fluid bolus with resolution of BP to 130s, but remained tachy to low 100s. A CT ab/pelvis revealed a fluid collection on her left flank. No PE was noted. She continued to receive Vanc/flagyl and got a dose of zosyn, with admission for further work up. . ROS was negative for chest pain, syncope or presyncope, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. Patient did not have any other complaints. She reported that her tremor has been present since she was in her 20s, related to a medication effect. . This am on the floor she was intermittently oriented to place and month but sometimes thinking she was stranded without her car and needing help.  She did complain of anxiety once, calling for help, and was verbally calmed down then noted to be tachycardic to the 140s. Cardiology was consulted, with carotid massage x 2 performed, with return to normal sinus rythm.  [**Name (NI) **] son notes that her speech is significantly more garbled in the last two to three days than previously. She began to have difficulty speaking status post extubation during the previous ICU stay, but her speech has become progressively worse. He confirms that the patient has had a baseline tremor, thought to be due to a medication effect 20 years ago. By the time the son visited the patient in the late morning, her tremor had improved, though it did intermittently worsen when the patient became more anxious.  Son also noted that pt had intermittently stared off into space and been less responsive for a few minutes, then would return to conversation.

Changes at discharge: 1+ bilateral foot edema, trace bilateral lower extremity edema, alert and oriented x 3, answering questions appropriately  Pertinent Results: ============ Radiology ============  CT Torso [**11-9**] 1. No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic abnormality. 2. 2.2 x 2.0 cm fluid and air collection in the subcutaneous tissues of the left lateral abdominal wall that could reflect post-operative seroma, but abscess cannot be excluded. 3. No evidence large fluid collection surrounding spinal fixation hardware in the lumbar spine, although artifact obscures fine detail and evaluation is suboptimal. 4. Cirrhotic liver with ascites. 5. Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the left and small on the right with adjacent atelectasis. 6. Atherosclerotic disease.  CT Head [**11-10**] IMPRESSION: Limited study due to patient motion. Within this limitation, no acute intracranial abnormalities identified.  Repeat study [**11-10**] Several rounded areas of hypodensity are seen within the left frontal region seen on axial images only that are likely areas of volume averaging, however, peripheral areas of infarction cannot be entirely excluded, and if of clinical concern, a repeat examination or MR can be performed. No evidence of hemorrhage.  MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**11-11**] IMPRESSION: 1. No definite acute infarction. 2. Mild-to-moderate dilatation of the lateral ventricles, with features as described above and slightly out of proportion to the prominence of the cerebral sulci; while this can relate to volume loss, associated communicating hydrocephalus/NPH cannot be completely excluded. To correlate clinically  ============ Neurology ============ EEG [**11-13**] This is a normal routine EEG in the waking and drowsy states. Note is made by technician of intermittent left leg shaking without obvious epileptiform discharges or EEG correlate seen during that time. Due to technical difficulties, video was unavailable for review. No focal, lateralized, or epileptiform features were noted during this recording. Note is made of a tachycardia of 108 bpm in a single EKG channel.  24 hour EEG [**11-18**] This 24 hour video EEG telemetry capture no electrographic seizures. There were no clear focal or lateralizing epileptiform features. The background showed a slightly disorganized alpha theta rhythm which would be normal for advanced age.  =========== Cytology ============ Pleural fluids [**11-14**] NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.  ============ Cardiology ============  Stress test [**11-12**] No anginal symptoms or ischemic ST segment changes to pharmacologic stress. Appropriate blood pressure response with flat heart rate response to Persantine infusion. Nuclear report sent separately.  TTE [**11-14**] The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior wall and mid-inferior septum and inferolateral walls. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to moderate ([**11-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-11-5**], regional left ventricular systolic function is now improved. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.  =========== Micro =========== [**2125-11-13**] 7:38 pm MRSA SCREEN:  No MRSA isolated.

She had been discharged from [**Hospital1 **] following hospitalization from presumed sepsis and hypotension on [**2125-11-5**] to rehab. On the evening of [**11-9**] a moonlighter was called for increasing agitation. It is unclear at what point she received 0.5mg of ativan. The patient was confused (oriented x1) with a question of increasing tremor and possibly slurred speech and was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for concern of seizures v. sepsis with AMS. On the day of admission, patient was transferred to the MICU for an episode of unresponsiveness on the floor. The patient rapidly improved in regards to her mental status upon admission to the MICU. CT head and MRI were negative, and Neuro felt this event was likely toxic/metabolic in nature. She was called out to the floor where an EEG was performed and negative. She underwent diagnosistc thoracentesis which was transudative in nature on [**11-12**]. Post-thoracentesis CXR detected a left hemidiaphagm and repeat film several hours later was performed while the patient was having another episode of shaking. She became unresponsive and was noted to have shallow breathing. The xray technicians at the patient's side were unable to palpate a pulse so CPR was initiated and a code was called. Code team immediately noted that patient was in A fib, and CPR was stopped. Patient at this time was awake but delirious. Her oxygen saturation began to plummet and decreased breath sounds were noted on the left side. CXR revealed a large hydrothorax, and patient was transferred back to the MICU. A chest tube was placed and blood tinged sanguinous fluid returned. Patient was intubated for airway protection.  Patient remained in the MICU from [**11-12**] through [**11-18**]. While in the MICU she was extubated on [**11-14**]. She required pressors from [**11-12**] through [**11-15**]. Her hypotension was felt to be due to hypovolemia secondary to dramatic chest tube fluid output. Chest tube drained between 2 and 4 L per day of ascitic fluid from presumed hepatic hydrothorax. Cardiac enzymes were slightly elevated, but consistent with her level of renal dysfunction and was felt not to have ACS. She had several TTEs which showed improving systolic function from EF 35 to 50%.  The patient required 2 untis of PRBC transfusion in the unit and multiple albumin bags for resuscitation. Thoracic surgery was consulted on [**11-16**] for assistance on hydrothorax management, and they advised no surgical intervention. Instead the chest tube was placed to waterseal on [**11-17**] and diuresis was initiated with lasix drip per thoracic surgery recommendations. A diaphragmatic defect was not felt to be responsible. The patient was able to maintain her pressures, and she tolerated diuresis with these maneuvers. Her course in the MICU was also complicated by intermittent episodes of sinus tachycardia to has high as 140s bpm which responded transiently to carotid massage. Her sinus tach was felt to be due to [**Last Name (un) 3041**] shifts and anxiety. She was transferred out of the MICU on [**11-18**]. No clear cause for her change in mental status was found while in the MICU. A repeat EEG was again negative, and Neurology once again felt that this was likely multifactorial toxic/metabolic insults in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure, liver disease, chf, dm and hypoxia from chronic pleural effusions.  Back on the medical floor, she continued to improve.  # Altered mental status: Her altered mental status was likely related to medication side effects or hepatic encephalopathy. Her Elavil was decreased for possible anticholinergic side effects.  If her mental status worsens, suggest changing patient over to nortripytline and checking levels.  # Tachycardia: Her sinus tachycardia improved after adding metoprolol back to her medication regimen.  # Anemia: She had a hematocrit drop while in the MICU without clear source and was guaiac negative. After 2 units pRBCs on [**11-15**], her hematocrit was stable.  # Osteomyelitis: Patient is on long term vanco/metronidazole since previous hospitalization for L2 osteo and is followed by ID as an outpatient. She is to continue vancomycin until [**2125-12-16**] and flagyl until [**2125-12-20**].  # Mild systolic congestive heart failure: She was diuresed as above. Patient's most recent EF 50%.  # NASH Cirrhosis: She was seen by hepatology during this admission.  She had a low MELD.  Patient was started on aldactone and diuresed as above.  She is to follow-up with the liver center as an outpatient.  # Inverted nipple noted on exam: Patient will need follow up with PCP for this issue.  # DM: She was continued on an insulin sliding scale.  # Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 40153**], son [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 40152**], [**Name2 (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 40154**]  Full code  Medications on Admission: Per last D/C sum: Acetaminophen 325 mg prn q6 Amitriptyline 75mg qHS Bisacodyl 10 mg dailr prn Docusate Sodium 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] prn Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg (65 mg Iron) daily Furosemide 40 mg daily Heparin SC 5,000 Units TID Lidocaine 5 %(700 mg/patch) daily prn Megestrol 40 mg TID Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] Metronidazole 500 mg q8 Miconazole Nitrate 2 % Powder [**Hospital1 **] Pantoprazole 40 mg Daily Sennosides [**Hospital1 **] prn Simvastatin 40 mg daily Trifluoperazine 2 mg daily Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q 24H Insulin SS  Discharge Medications: 1.

Please note per history, the patient has history of lung cancer. Comparison is also made to scout radiograph from CT from [**2160-11-12**]. Large area of opacity projecting over the left lung is worrisome for infectious process, alternatively progression of malignancy/lymphangitic spread. Opacity is seen to a lesser extent in the right lung. There may be superimposed pulmonary edema. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Again seen, the upper two sternal wires are fractured. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  CXR [**2160-12-8**]- As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase in extent of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities. This increase is most noticeable in the right upper lobe. No other relevant changes. Status post sternotomy, CABG, moderate cardiomegaly, the presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  Transthoracic echocardiogram [**2160-12-9**]- Poor image quality.The left atrium is moderately dilated. A small secundum atrial septal defect is present. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and infero-lateral akinesis and distal septal, distal anterior and apical hypokinesis. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2160-8-28**], the degree of MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] seen has increased slightly (degree of MR [**First Name (Titles) 12314**] [**Last Name (Titles) 102625**] on prior report).  CT Head [**2160-12-10**]- WET READ- 1. No evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or major vascular territory infarction. Evaluation of small mass, however, is limited in the absence of IV contrast. 2. Remote right middle cerebral artery infarction.   Brief Hospital Course: 77 M with history of stage IIIa NSCLC, sCHF with EF 35-40%, CAD s/p CABG presenting initially for n/v/[**Hospital **] transferred to ICU for hypotension, hypoxia, and fever.  # Respiratory distress: Patient transferred to ICU on HD 1 due to episode of hypotension and hypoxia while receiving blood transfusion.  Patient continued to be hypotensive and hypoxic throughout the day with an increasing O2 requirement.  He spiked a fever and CXR was concerning for new pneumonia, so vancomycin, cefepime and levofloxacin were started.  Patient was transferred to the ICU for close monitoring.  His blood pressure remained stable with normal mentation and good urine output, and he did not require any fluid boluses or pressors.  He continued to require a non rebreather to maintain oxygen saturations, and de-sat'ed to 70s without the facemask. Concerns were for bacterial pneumonia vs PCP pneumonia vs radiation pneumonitis vs worsening of underlying malignancy. Patient was initially put on steroids to treat radiation pneumonitis in addition the antibiotics as above to cover hospital acquired bacterial pneumonia.  Patient's oxygen requirement increased overnight on HD 3 and so treatment for PCP pneumonia was started with high dose bactrim.  Steroids were altered to treat PCP rather than radiation pneumonitis.  Beta glucan and galactomannan were also sent on HD 2. Once patient was made comfort measures only, antibiotics and steroids were discontinued, and focus was turned towards controlling tachypnea and dyspnea with morphine and albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers.  Patient was kept on shovel mask and nasal cannula and was given morphine as needed for assistance with breathing. Family requested to have oxygen removed, and start morphine drip.  Drip started, and nasal cannula/shovel mask removed and patient expired within 30 minutes.  # Right MCA stroke: On HD 3, housestaff was called to bedside for acute change in patient's breathing.  Patient was noted to have left sided neglect in addition to complete left sided hemiplegia.  A code stroke was called and a CT of the head showed a non-hemorrhagic stroke in the right MCA, adjacent to prior stroke.  TPA was not given as neurology felt that it was high risk for re-bleed of prior stroke.  Patient was started on aspirin 325mg, however, once decision was made to make patient comfort measures only, aspirin was discontinued.  # Insomnia: Patient struggled with insomnia throughout admission.  He was prescribed olanzapine in the outpatient setting which helped him sleep at doses of 15mg qHS.  With the assistance of palliative care, patient was continued on olanzapine 10mg qHS.  He was also given morphine as needed for comfort as part of his difficulty sleeping was secondary to his tachypnea.  # Goals of care: Several goals of care discussions occurred during hospitalization.  Following patient's stroke, he and his family decided that they wanted him to be comfort measures only and to go home with hospice.  However, patient developed increased work of breathing and family requested morphine boluses.  Patient was made comfortable with morphine boluses, then morphine drip and expired at 07:11am on [**2160-12-11**].

Brief Hospital Course: C. difficile colitis/Sepsis: Given history of recurrent C. difficile colitis, diarrhea, and sepsis, etiology was presumed to be CDAD, confirmed on stool cx.  She was started on PO vanco, IV flagyl empirically.  CT scan demonstrated colitis.  Patient was admitted to the ICU for aggressive IVF, though patient refused central line.  She was briefly on peripheral levophed. ID and GI were consulted.  After adequate resuscitation, she stabilized clinically and was transferred to the medical floor. Her diarrhea improved, though her flagyl was stopped after she developed parasthesias.  Reviewing the record, it appeared that she stopped her previous taper early.  Therefore, a more aggressive taper was pursued, deferring possible fecal transplantation to the outpatient setting, as well as rifamixin. . ARF: Likely pre-renal.  Resolved with IVF resusitation . h/o DVT: Coumadin was reversed initially.  However, once she stabilized it was restarted with lovenox bridge.

Dig level 1.5  Brief Hospital Course: 72 yo female with severe ventricular dysfunction (EF 10%) secondary to polysubstance abuse and HIV (last CD4 359) who presented with bradycardia secondary to digoxin and amiodarone toxicity. . # Rhythm: Found to be bradycardic to 30's in ED in setting of digoxin toxicity with amiodarone and hyperkalemia contributing. Patient had been started on amiodarone at her last hospitalization due to runs of VTach.  Pacer pads were placed but she did not require transcutaneous pacing.  An isoproterenol drip was started which increased her Heart rates to 50's-60's (although initially remained in junctional rhythm).  Digoxin and amiodarone were held.  An attempt was made to place a temporary pacing wire, but this attempt was unsuccessful because of thrombosed veins.  The isoprotenenol drip was stopped on [**8-18**]. Patient will not go home on amiodarone and will go home on Digoxin 0.125 mg qod. . # Pump: EF 10% on last echo ([**2136-8-3**]).  She appeared euvolemic on admission so lasix was held.  She developed increased shortness of breath and CXR was consistent with pulmonary edema, so patient was diuresed with lasix. A foley catheter was placed to monitor accurate I/Os. Digoxin and ACEI were held. ACEI will be held until she follows up in clinic with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**].  # CAD: No evidence of active ischemia during admission. Normal perfusion images in [**2133**].  # HIV: Last CD4 359 in 04/[**2136**].  Patient requested that her [**Year (4 digits) 2775**] therapy be stopped as she felt that this made her nauseated and gave her abdominal discomfort.  Her PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] and made aware that the [**Name (NI) 2775**] was stopped.  Her bactrim prophylaxis was continued.

Brief Hospital Course: In Brief, the patient is an 88 year old man with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p BiV-ICD placement, atrial flutter, CAD, chronic kidney disease who presented with hypoxic respiratory failure and shock which was stablized.  His course was further complicated by acute abdomial pain, psoas muscle hematoma, upper GI bleed, acute on chronic renal failure, heparin induced thrombocytopenia with upper extremity DVT, intermittent hypoxia, and urinary retention. .  1) Shock - Patient intially presented in shock requiring vasopressors.  Cardiac index was normal with decreased SVR which were not consistent with cardiogenic shock. The likely cause of was distributive/septic shock of unclear source of infection. He completed a full course of empiric antibiotics.  He completed 7 days of hydrocortisone/fludrocort for sub-optimal response to ACTH.  BP stablized by time of discharge. . 2) Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented in hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to CHF, hypoventilation and decreased mental status.  He was intubated prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].  He was weaned from the ventilator successfully.  He did have intermittent hypoxia largely secondary to pulmonary edema from inadequate diuresis.  He was stabilized on standing twice daily lasix. He was started on BiPaP at night for hypoventilation. . 3) Abdominal pain - During the hospital stay he developed acute severe epigastric pain.  He was transfered to the MICU for concern for mesenteric ischemia.  An abominal CTA was negative for this.  A surgery consult was obtained and recommended no surgical intervention.  The pain resolved without specific intervention. He was subsequently found to have an psoas muscle hematoma and required several blood transfusions with appropriate response in his hematocrit.  4) Cardiovascular: a. CAD- history of MI s/p CABG. will continue ASA, simvastatin, beta-blocker. . b. Pump- Severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 10-15% s/p BiV-ICD placement. No evidence of cardiogenic shock upon initial presenation as C.I. was normal.  Medically managed CHF with ACEi, beta-blocker, digoxin, spironolactone, furosemide. . c. rhythm- [**Hospital1 **]-V paced with underlying rhythm is atrial flutter/fibrillation. Started on amiodarone for maintenance of sinus rhythm to maximize likelihood of atrial kick. Also, amiodarone to decrease in-appropriate shocks from ICD.  5) Upper GI bleed - The patient did develop guaiac positive stools in the setting of anticoagulation for the atrial fibrillation. The hematocrit drop was largely due to the psoas hematoma as above.  The patient refused EGD.  If the patient develops recurrent melenotic stools he could be referred to GI for endoscopy.  He will continue on a PPI. . 6)Acute on Chronic Renal failure - Initial creatinine down from admission to peak 2.5 this was likely from pre-renal secondary to shock state; no evidence of ATN. By time of discharge, the creatinine had resolved to baseline. . 7) Anemia-  In addition the the acute blood loss anemia as described above.  The patient has a chronic microcytic anemia. Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease (labs drawn before blood transfusions were given).  Also with regard to the significant microcytosis and his Italian extraction, hemoglobin electrophoresis was performed to evaluate for thallasemia.  These results were pending at time of discharge. . 8) Thrombocytopenia - HIT type II. PF4 positive on [**2120-12-27**], Platelets stable at around 70K with subsequent recovery to greater than 150K. He did have a left upper extremity venous clot although the developement of this was after his platelets had stabilized.  Started argatroban on [**2120-12-27**] with transition to coumadin.  He continued on argatroban until his INR on combined anti-coagulation was >4. At which time he was maintained on coumadin alone. . 9) Urinary retention: - The patient has no prior history of urinary retention, nocturia, frequency or related BPH symptoms. During one attempt at removing the foley catheter he had decreased urine output with a large volume detected on bladder scan.  The foley was replaced.  He was started on finasteride, not wanting to use an alpha-blocker that would likely cause hypotension when added to his extensive cardiac regimen.  The catheter was left in at discharge.  This should be removed in [**2-9**] days followed by confirmation that the patient can urinate. . 10) Code Status: DNR/DNI confirmed with patient and HCP. . 11) Dispo: the patient was discharged to rehab   Medications on Admission: Hydrocortisone Na 50 mg IV q6 RISS Ipratropium MDI prn Tylenol prn Albuterol prn Lactulose 30 mg po q8 prn Pantoprazole 40 mg po q24 hr Amiodarone 200 mg po qday ASA 81 mg po qday Colace 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] Senna [**Hospital1 **] Fludrocortisone 0.05 mg po qday Simvastatin 40 mg po qday Heparin gtt Zosyn 2.25 mg IV q6   Discharge Medications: 1.

Two days later she presented to the ED with dysphagia and found to have cellulitis of surgical wound. She was hospitalized for 5 days, treated with antibiotics and discharged on Keflex. She had been doing well until Tuesday/Wed when she began experiencing fevers with associated generalized malaise, fatigue and weakness. These symptoms persisted, did improve with Tylenol or Advil, until she saw her OTL surgeon this morning for follow up. She was found to be febrile to 103 and with hypotension to mid-80s systolic. She was sent to the ED with evaluation.  On review of systems the patient is completely asymptomatic aside from weakness and malaise. No sore throat, no runny nose, eye pain or discharge, sinus pain, no neck pain or stiffness, no redness, swelling or pain at site of incision. No cough, SOB, chest pain, no abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Patient does endorse increased urinary frequency but no dysuria. No rashes or joint pain, no leg swelling.  In the ED, initial vitals were 99 101 93/49 16 96%.  CBC showed white blood cell count of 5.1K.  Sodium was 128 on Chem7. Lactate was 1.0.  Urinalysis was negative and blood cultures were sent.  Patient was administered 1 liter NS.  Chest X-ray showed no focal consolidation or effusion, no acute process. ENT was consulted and initially did not think there was anything going on with the surgical site.  CT neck was performed which showed fat stranding at site of right posterior submandibular node resection, with no drainable fluid collection.  Overall there was an improved post-op appearance compared to recent imaging in [**4-/2154**], with less mass effect upon the parapharyngeal space and stable edema of the right sternocleidomastoid.  CTA chest was also performed with no pulmonary emboli noted, but scattered mediastinal lymph nodes measuring up to 9 mm. Initially, cephalexin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were administered PO.  Patient was admitted to observation with plan for likely discharge in the morning.  Around 0230, patient dropped systolic blood pressures to 70s, was tachycardic to the 130s, with a temperature of 104.8F, RR 40s, with O2 sat 77% on RA, but improved to mid-90s with nasal cannula O2 administration.  She was reported to have skin mottling of the extremities.  A left external jugular peripheral line was inserted and administration of 2 liters NS IVF was bolused. Patient was administed vancomycin, ceftriaxone and metronidazole IV.  ENT was contact[**Name (NI) **] and recommended MICU admission, and thought there was no surgical intervention needed.

Treatment with fluids and Abx in ICU resolved hypotension and fever, but she developed a rash which is most likely drug-induced. Abx discontinued and she was transfered to the floor where she has remained stable. Discharged on hospital stay day 4.  Active issues: # Cellulitis: Pt admitted with hypotension occurring during treatment for cellulitis on Keflex.  Pt received approximately 13days of Keflex prior to admission to ICU. While in the ICU pt received Vanc/CTX/Flagyl IV and ICU stay was complicated by drug eruption (see below).  IV abx were discontinued and pt remained afebrile and stable for >36 hrs prior to discharge.  Pt was transferred to the floor where she continued to do well with no evidence of recurrence of cellulitis. We discussed with ENT and they agreed that she does not need to be sent home on antibiotics.  # Drug Eruption: Pt. was febrile, tachycardic and hypotensive with pruritic pink papules over her back and arms that developed after taking a cephalosporin for post-op cellulitis.  There was no infectious etiology determined as CXR, UA, Ucx were negative and CT of neck did not reveal a fluid collection around surgical site.  Pt was fluid resuscitated and received benadryl and famotidine for drug rxn and topical steroid for pruritis. Eruption slowly faded and became non-pruritic.  #Hyponatremia: Most likely hypovolemic hyponatremia that resolved with fluid resuscitation.  # Anemia: unknown etiology with HH 11.4&35.

Opacities in both bases are likely secondary to atelectasis. Followup PA and lateral examinations may be helpful when the patient is clinically able.  CTA CHEST: The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are unremarkable. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion. No significant axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is identified. The central airways are patent bilaterally.  There is a large saddle embolus in the right main pulmonary artery, which nearly completely occludes the right lower lobe pulmonary artery, and there is evidence of wedge shaped, parenchymal opacity localized to the right lower lobe, which may represent pulmonary infarction. Some contrast passes the embolism to the right middle and right upper lobe pulmonary arteries, and the lung parenchyma in these areas is unremarkable. There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism on the left side. The left lung fields are clear.  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver enhances homogeneously, without evidence of focal intrahepatic lesion. There is no evidence of ascites. There is no evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. There is evidence of a subcutaneous Chemo-Port in the left abdominal wall, with a peritoneal catheter extending into the left lower quadrant. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast normally bilaterally. The ureters are normal in appearance, without evidence of hydronephrosis. Within the midpole of the right kidney, there is a low attenuation focus measuring 1.4 x 1.8 cm, which contains low-density fluid, consistent with a simple cyst. Smaller hypodensities are seen throughout both kidneys, but are too small to definitively characterize. The stomach and opacified loops of intraabdominal bowel are unremarkable. There is no free air, free fluid, or pathologic mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  Expansile, centrally located thrombus is seen within the left gonadal vein, beginning inferiorly at the level of the mid psoas muscle and extending proximally up to and involving the confluence at the superior mesenteric vein. No thrombus is seen more proximally than the SMV. Expansile, acute thrombus is also seen within the left common femoral vein, extending proximally to the level of the pubic symphysis.  CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon, pelvic loops of bowel, urinary bladder, and distal ureters are unremarkable. The patient is status post hysterectomy. No free fluid is seen within the pelvis, and no abnormal pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy is identified.  CT head: 1. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. 2. No enhancing lesions identified. 3. Mottled appearance of the calvarium, suggesting possible renal osteodystrophy.  EKG: nl sinus; Left axis deviation; t wave inversion III; .5mm st depression V5-6  Brief Hospital Course: . A/P: 70 y.o. woman with a history of metastatic ovarian CA presenting with chest pain, found to have large pulmonary embolus with significant DVT clot burden, hemodynamically stable, saturating well on RA, now on lovenox. . # PE with large DVT clot burden. The patient presented with chest pain and was found on CT scan to have a large saddle embolus with near complete occlusion of the RLL pulmonary artery and a likely infarct of the RLL. CT scan also revealed left common femoral vein DVT and Left gonadal vein thrombus. It is likely that these clots occurred secondary to hypercoaguability of malignancy. The patient was hemodynamically stable. EKG showed sinus tachycardia without clear signs of Right heart strain. The patient was initiated on IV heparin and briefly sent to the ICU out of concern for her considerable clot burden and potential hemodynamic complications. The patient had a fever, likely secondary to her clot burden. The patient was changed to lovenox for long-term anticoagulation. She remained hemodynamically stable throughout her admission, saturating well (>95%) on RA and with improved chest pain. Lower extremity ultrasound was ordered to further assess clot burden. However, the ultrasound tech was not available to complete the study and after discussion with radiology it was felt that the CT scan provided adequate imaging of the deep veins. There was no change of management to be made based upon the Lower extremity ultrasound study. The patient will likely require life-long lovenox vs. coumadin therapy. . # Anemia. On admission, the patient's Hct dropped from 34.4 to a nadir of 26.4 in the setting of new anticoagulation. The patient had no obvious source of bleeding. The patient's Hct stabilized and trended upward prior to discharge. . # Ovarian CA. Intravenous and intraperitoneal chemotherapy per primary oncologist. . # HTN. Well controlled on CCB and diuretic. . # Leukopenia. Likely secondary to chemotherapy. Not neutropenic by numbers. . # Fever. Resolved. Likely secondary to clot burden. Cultures without growth to date. . # Hyperlipidemia. The patient's statin therapy was held while LFT's were elevated, likely secondary to recent chemotherapy. This therapy was re-instated prior to discharge as her LFT's normalized.   Medications on Admission: MEDICATIONS:  Norvasc 5 mg po QD, this is dose reduced from her primary care doctor from 10 mg po QD.

Metastatic ovarian cancer Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia   Discharge Condition: Good, saturating well on room air with decreased chest pain.   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with chest pain. This was likely due to blood clots in your lungs. These clots came from the blood vessels in your legs and abdomen. This is likely a complication from your ovarian cancer. You were started on a medication, called lovenox (also called enoxaparin), to thin your blood and prevent further clotting. Please inject this medication as you have been taught twice a day. . Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2244**] in the oncology clinic on [**2156-12-2**] for further management of your ovarian cancer and blood clot complications. . Take all medications as prescribed. The only change in your medications is the addition of Lovenox (also called enoxaparin). .

HYPONATREMIA: Etiology was likely hypovolemic hyponatremia in the setting of over-aggressive diuretic use and decreased dietary intake of sodium.  Patient had started dieting, eating less salt and drinking more water.  He presented with hypotension and tachycardia.  Patient also presented with acute kidney injury, elevated lactate, fractional excretion of sodium less than 1, low urine sodium, and elevated creatinine and BUN all suggesting hypovolemic hyponatremia as the etiology. While in the MICU his sodium was corrected with normal saline and his urine and serum sodium trended. Once his sodium was trending upward he was transferred to the medicine floor.  His torsemide was held and then restarted on [**8-7**] on an every other day dosing schedule, and he should follow up with his PCP for repeat lab testing.  # HYPOTENSION / TACHYCARDIA - Though initially concerned for SIRS/sepsis because of leukocytosis on admission, and possible source of infection being cellulitis from chronic venous stasis ulcers.  CXR, UA, blood cultures were all negative for signs of infection.  He did not have fever of systemic signs of infection.  Initially he met systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria with a possible source. He was started on vancomycin and unasyn empirically. On re-evaluation he remained afebrile with no constitutional symptoms concerning for sepsis. His vancomycin and unysin was discontinued and keflex was kept on per his vascular physicians prescription. Hypotension was likely a result of extracellular volume depletion in the setting of overdiuresis and salt restriction as above, with a reactive tachycardia.  Metoprolol, digoxin, and diltiazem were held for hypotension but restarted as his pressures tolerated them.  He was monitored on telemetry and was not shown to have any atrial fibrillation with RVR.  However, he had asymptomatic sinus tachycardia to the 130-160s during physical therapy.  This was likely because his home medications were held, and his tachycardia improved upon restarting digoxin, metoprolol, and diltiazem at his home doses.  Torsemide was restarted on an every other day dosing schedule.  #. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Chronic issue. On coumadin, metoprolol, diltizem, and digoxin at home. In the MICU, he became mildly hypotensive (sbp in 90s, not requiring pressors) so his metoprolol and diltiazem were reduced in dose.  Upon trasnfer to floor, blood pressure was stable after resuming home meidcations and metoprolol was uptitrates in setting of tachycardia, particularly with exertion with PT. He should follow up with his PCP regarding titration of his rate control. His INR was subtherapeutic, so his warfarin was increased to 6mg. Digoxin was continued and level was not toxic.  #. Acute kidney injury: Likely prerenal and related to hypoperfusion in the setting of hypotension. creatinine improved with holding torsemide and administration of IVF. His creatine and BUN were trended and his creatine trended downward with IV fluids.  #. STASIS DERMATITIS WITH POSSIBLE SUPER IMPOSED CELLULITIS: While in the MICU he did not spike a fever or appear overtly septic by exam or review of systems. His leukocytosis normalized. The decision was made to leave him on his outpatient dose of keflex however pending follow-up with his vascular physician.  #. CIRRHOSIS: This is a diagnosis that is currently undergoing outpatient workup. He did not appear hypervolemic and this was not likely related to the etiology of his hyponatremia. He denies alcohol abuse and is reportedly planning on undergoing a liver biopsy to further characterize his liver disease. His liver function was monitored while in the MICU and remained stable, and no further management of his possible cirrhosis was performed.   TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -Vascular, renal, and hepatic follow-up. -Should f/u with PCP regarding torsemide dosing which was decreased to every other day.  He should be evaluated for less aggressive diuresis if has bump in creatinine. -He should follow up with his PCP and cardiology regarding titration of his metoprolol and diltiazem for rate control. -Warfarin increased to 6mg at discharge as his INR was 1.4  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 10840**],  You were treated at [**Hospital1 18**] for low sodium and decreased kidney function.  Your low sodium and decreased kidney function were likely caused by a combination of not eating and drinking as much as you used to, as well as your torsemide diuretic.  As we gave you fluid and discontinued your torsemide, your sodium level improved.  Please restart your torsemide, but at a lower dose.  Take 20 mg every other day until you see your cardiologist and primary care doctor.  You should take your next dose on Monday [**2173-8-9**].  Your kidney function also improved with IV fluids, and is now normal.  Please have your INR checked on Tuesday [**2173-8-10**].  You may need adjustment in your coumadin dose.  For now, you should take 6 mg per day as your INR is low.  Please keep the appointments listed below.  Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.

Found to be hypotensive (SBP in 60s) and bradycardic (HR 30s). EMS was called and transported him to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER. In the ER, he was given atropine x2, glucagon, calcium and 1.5L NS. EKGs showed bradycardia at rate of ~30, with no definite P waves, but a baseline suggestive of afib/flutter. No qwaves, no ST or T wave changes. He was still hypotensive so a R IJ was placed and he was started on a dopamine gtt at 15 mcg/hr. . Was diagnosed w/ afib about a week ago. Had a persistent chest cold for approx. 3 weeks, went to see his PCP who examined him and found him to be in rapid afib w/ HR of 170s by EKG. From his PCP's office, he was sent to the ER at [**Hospital6 **]. He was admitted and was finally rate controlled in the ED (to HR of 96) after 35mg IV diltiazem and 60mg PO diltiazem. Was d/c on atenolol and diltiazem on [**12-29**] and represented to the ER on [**12-31**] via EMS because of SOB, lightheadedness, and 3 episodes of chest pressure at home. He was observed overnight, r/o MI by 3 sets of neg CE and had a stress test which was negative. He was then sent home on [**1-1**]. He decided at that point that perhaps his symptoms were due to his warfarin so he started taking 2mg QHS instead of 5mg QHS as instructed. He continued to take the atenolol and diltiazem as instructed. Today, he felt well when he woke up but began to have symptoms of lightheadedness, SOB, and leg heaviness about an hour after he took his medications. He went to his PCP's office, as he had a previously scheduled appointment, and she called EMS who brought him here. .

Imaging: [**1-3**] CXR - There are no prior studies available for comparison. There is a right internal jugular vein line, with its tip at the superior vena cava/right atrial junction. No pneumothorax is seen. The heart size is at the upper limits of normal for technique. The pulmonary vascularity is normal in appearance without redistribution. No pleural effusions are seen, though the extreme right costophrenic angle has been excluded from the study. There are no focal consolidations. . [**2163-1-5**] TEE - 1. The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage. The right atrium is dilated. 2.The left ventricular cavity size is normal. The left ventricular function is hard to assess given that the ventricular rate is very rapid but there is probably moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with an EF of 35-40%. 3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. 4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. 5.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 6.There is no pericardial effusion. . IMPRESSION: No thrombus in the left or right atria. Moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.  Brief Hospital Course: 51yo M w/ hypotension and bradycardia, likely in setting of CCB and BB for his newly diagnosed afib. . # CV: * Rhythm: Mr. [**Known lastname 107906**] bradycardia was likely due to excessive nodal blockade from CCB and BB since he recovered his rate and BP off all nodal blocking agents. He then went back into rapid afib, with HR up to 160s despite the addition of BB. His BP remained stable so the decision was made to attempt cardioversion. TEE showed no clot and DCCV was attempted but he was only able to maintain NSR for ~30 sec. He continued to be in afib w/ RVR, with a rate as high as 160-170. Diltiazem 30mg PO QID was added, still with insufficient control of his rate. The diltiazem dose was then increased to 60mg TID on [**1-6**] due to persistent tachycardia with good effect on his rate. EP was consulted to help guide the management of his arrhythmia and they recommended discontinuing his diltiazem and instead attempting to control his rhythm (and rate) with amiodarone. He was started on 400mg PO TID x1 week, with the plan to decrease to [**Hospital1 **] dosing x1 week then QD dosing. Once he had received an adequate amiodarone load, the plan was to attempt another DCCV as an outpatient. Mr. [**Known lastname **] discussed this plan with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] who also wanted him to wear [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor upon discharge. Mr. [**Known lastname **] was instructed in the use of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor and was told to send in rhythm strips to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] daily, so his rate and his intervals could be monitored daily. Despite the initiation of amiodarone, Mr. [**Known lastname **] also needed a beta-blocker to keep his rate under control. His beta-blocker was slowly increased up to 75mg PO QID and was then switched to Toprol XL 300mg PO QD prior to discharge. The Toprol XL and amiodarone allowed Mr. [**Known lastname **] to achieve a resting heart rate of 90-100s. Coumadin was started on [**1-4**] with a goal INR of [**1-7**]. He was kept on a heparin gtt until his INR was therapeutic. He was discharged on 3mg of coumadin daily, and his INR on discharge was 2.4. . * Pump: Although Mr. [**Known lastname **] had no evidence of heart failure by exam (lungs were CTAB and his JVP was flat), his OSH ECHO and TEE here showed a depressed EF. After receiving IVF in the ER, he had some swelling in his hands and feet which resolved on its own. He never required diuresis with lasix. . * Ischemia: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has no evidence of ischemia. His CE enzymes were negative x2. EKG has no evidence of ST or T wave changes. . # ARF: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was in mild ARF on admission, w/ Cr of 1.5 and K of 5.8. It resolved after receiving several liters of IVF in the ER. It was most likely prerenal +/- ATN from hypotension. His Cr was 1.2 on discharge (lowest value was 1.0 during his stay). . # FEN: He follwed a regular heart-healthy diet. No IVF were needed. His electrolytes were checked daily and were repleted prn to keep K >4 and Mg >2. . # ACCESS: He had a centrail line (R IJ) placed in the ER initially, but it was pulled after TEE/DCCV. He then had peripheral IVs for IV access. . # PPX: He was on heparin gtt as a bridge to coumadin until his INR was therapeutic. He had a bowel regimen. No PPI was indicated. . # CODE: FULL . # DISPO: To home, with [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts monitor.

Per report, pt was noted by staff at NH yesterday to be difficult to arouse and having labored breathing.  His vitals at the time included BP 112/57, and O2 sats and temperature were not obtainable due likely to hypothermia.  He was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further revaluation.  Of note, per his daughter, he was recently hospitalized ([**2015-7-16**]) from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital with congestive heart failure.  During this hospitalization he was noted to have deteriorating mental status and delirium, which is why he had been discharged to NH. In the ED, VS T 92.1 axillary, BP 100/50, HR 50, RR 21 88% 6L initially then placed 99% NRB.  He received vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and flagyl for aspiration pneumonia.  Also received vitamin K IV 10 mg for coagulopathy with INR to 7.2.  With CT head negative for acute intracranial process.  Also received 1 L IVF total in ED. On arrival to MICU, he was noteedd to be bradycardic to HRs to 30s and hypotensive to SBP 80s with MAPS 50s.  He was given 1 mg atropine with HR to 50s.  He was given 500 cc fluid bolus x 2 and SBP came up to 90s.

Extensive bilateral periventricular as well as subcortical white matter hypoattenuation related to chronic microangiopathic ischemic changes is evident.  The ventricles and sulci are moderately prominent, appropriate for age- associated involutionary changes. Bilateral basal ganglia calcification and extensive calcification along the tentorium and falx cerebri are evident. The osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable. A nonspecific focus of hyperdense focus is noted in the left pre-zygomatic soft tissue. Clinical correlation is advised.  IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. A small hyperdense focus in the left pre-zygomatic soft tissue could represent calcification and clinical correlation is advised.  ECHO The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 40 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is dilated at the sinus level. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Aortic stenosis. Dilated ascending aorta. If clinically indicated, a follow-up study to assess aortic stenosis is suggested when the patient can be transported to the Echo laboratory.   Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, who presented with hypoxia, hypotension, and hypothermia.  Upon admission to the MICU, agressive therapy was initiated keeping a broad differential diagnosis. Patient however continued to deteriorate and abruptly became profoundly bradycardic, unresponsive to atropine or increasing doses of pressors, culminating in asystole; patient was pronounced dead at 1:05am on [**2105-7-28**]. Below are the details leading to these events, arranged by problem:  1)Hypotension / Hypothermia: On initial presentation on the floor SBP 80s, given 500cc fluid bolus x 2 with SBP to 90s. Meets SIRS criteria with hypothermia and tachpnea and hypotension concerning for sepsis, with pneumonia as the most likely source.  Also on differential was hypovolemic hypotension for occult blood loss, cardiogenic shock, adrenal insuffiency and myxedema coma. Cooling blanket placed on patient upon arrival.  Patient was given fluid boluses and central access was obtained. Echocardiogram was obtained and revealed mildly depressed ejection fraction (40%) with inferolateral wall hypokinesis and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Central venous pressure was measured and found to be elvated to 24mmHg, which even in the setting of TR was felt to rule out hypovolemia. Patient was initiated on Dopamine in hopes of supporting both blood pressure and heart rate. Arterial line was placed for accurate assessment of arterial pressure. Hematocrit remained stable and pressure responded to pressor support.  Patient started on stress dose steroids for possible adrenal insufficiency.  2)Hypoxia: With bilateral infiltrates and likely superimposed fluid overlaod.  Given recent hospitalization and extent of O2 requirement, high suspicion for Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin and zosyn. This was later changed to Vancomycin and Cefepime. Patients blood gas was concerning for hypercarbia, and after re-discussing goals of care with family and confirming patient did not want to be intubated, non invasive ventillation was initiated. Patient tolerated NIPPV well and hypoxia / hypercarbia / respiratory acidosis improved until his sudden decompensation.  3)Bradycardia: With baseline bradycardia per history, unclear etiology.  On arrival to MICU, bradycardic to HR in 30s, gave 1 mg atropine with HR to 50s.  All nodal agents were stopped and heart rate improved with Dopamine administration.  4)Meningitis: Given patients poor baseline mental status and findings of significant nuchal rigidity, concern for meningitis was raised. Given patients decompensated status, lumbar puncture was not pursued and empiric coverage with Ampicillin for listeria, Vancomycin/Cefepime for Staph/Strep were initiated.  5)Hypothyroidism: TSH of 20, difficult to interpret in this setting as sick euthyroid may have impacted laboratory results. Given decompensated state, endocrine consult was placed and thyroid hormone was supplemented intravenously at higher doses than per outpatient regimen. Free T3, T4 and Thyroid binding protein were ordered but were not available before patient decompensated. Per endocrine team recommendations, T3 was not given due to concerns for arrythmia and cardiac side effects, and given very poor level of evidence for its efficacy.  6)Coagulopathy: INR 7.2 on admission in setting of anticoagulation.  Given vitamin K and FFP. DIC labs negative.  7)Chronic kidney disease: With known baseline CKD stage III, likely exacerbated in the setting of hypotension.

A CT scan at the outside hospital showed no extravasation; however, she was hypotensive on evaluation with severe abdominal pain.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for cryptogenic cirrhosis, mitral valve regurg, lap-chole, total abdominal hysterectomy, status post appendectomy, and status post ventral hernia repair.  MEDICATIONS:  Included propranolol, spironolactone, Lasix and Levoxyl.  ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.  PHYSICAL EXAM:  She was afebrile. VITAL SIGNS: Her heart rate was 65, blood pressure in the 60s, and she was 100% on 2 liters. She had significant abdominal tenderness with guarding.  Her white count was normal, INR was 1.3, and her PT was 30. Her BUN and creatinine were 27. and 1.5.  HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was taken to the operating room emergently for a question of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. Intraoperatively, it was found that she had a large aneurysm. There was also extensive bleeding from her cirrhosis and; therefore, she was left packed and open. Please see the operative report for further details. Postoperatively, she was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit, and she was aggressively resuscitated. After this was done, over the next couple of days she stabilized, bladder pressures were followed, and she was treated for ARDS with an esophageal balloon, and ventilatory management, and an echo was done which showed normal EF.  The patient was then returned to the operating room for abdominal washout. Transplant surgery was consulted who assisted in the operative intervention. At this time, it was decided that the patient would return to the operating room. During the second washout, a Vicryl mesh was placed, and a VAC dressing was continued. Her LFTs were followed, and her platelet count was also followed, and her platelet count began to slowly fall. Because of this, a HIT panel was sent, and this was positive. Her heparin was stopped, her lines were changed, and she was followed from this standpoint. Postoperatively, from the second washout she was continued on ventilatory management, and she was kept on Levophed for blood pressure control. She continued to require significant fluid resuscitation, as she was losing over 3-4 liters of ascites fluid from her open abdomen. VAC dressings were changed at the bedside multiple times, and there was slow granulation tissue. She was started on TPN for nutritional support during this time.  After multiple attempts at weaning the ventilator were attempted, it was decided that the patient would proceed to a tracheostomy, as she was not weaning adequately. Because of this, a tracheostomy was performed, and she did well from that standpoint. She slowly began to improve. However, LFTs continued to rise, and her VAC drain output continued to stay high at over 5 liters. She was continued to be replaced with albumin, as well as with IV fluid. During this time, she began spiking fevers. Pancultures were done, and she was found to have Pseudomonas in her lungs and; therefore, she was changed from Zosyn to meropenem. She became afebrile at that point, and she continued to do well from a pulmonary standpoint. However, she continued to require high ventilatory support with high PEEP and high pressure support, and she was intermittently switched back and forth between assist control and CPAP.  From a graft standpoint, she had palpable pulses and good distal perfusion throughout. She was attempted on multiple occasions to be given anticoagulation using argatroban and lepirudin. However, her creatinine clearance and primary liver function abnormalities did not allow for adequate anticoagulation. She had multiple episodes of bleeding, both from her NG tube, as well as from her Foley which required significant blood product resuscitation. As her bilirubin and LFTs began to rise, and her VAC output continued to rise, a hepatology consult was performed, and a liver ultrasound was also done. The liver ultrasound found that she had thrombosed her portal vein, and because of her dropping hematocrit, the hepatology service proceeded with an endoscopy. Multiple esophageal varices were identified, and while no active bleeding was present, these were significant, and felt that they would likely cause bleeding in the future. Therefore, they were banded.  Again, she began having high fevers, and she had ventilator acquired pneumonia with the Pseudomonas, and this had now become resistant to meropenem. Therefore, she was changed to ciprofloxacin. At the same time, she had blood cultures which had gram-positive cocci. She was started empirically on vancomycin. During one of these episodes of hypotension, she had some [**Known lastname **] changes which were concerning for myocardial ischemia. An EKG was done, and cardiology was consulted. They felt that ultimately this was due to demand ischemia from her overwhelming sepsis. They had no further suggestions other than supportive care as tolerable.  Multiple family meetings were done, as the patient continued to not improve. The family was present throughout multiple of these decisions, and it was decided ultimately that she would be made DNR pending any further results or deterioration. After proceeding with the ultrasound and finding the thrombosis of her portal vein, a repeat family meeting was held, and it was decided that the patient would be made comfort measures only. She was made comfort measures on [**2118-3-15**] and passed away shortly thereafter. Patient's family was present throughout the entire time, and after the meeting was there at the time when the patient passed away. Patient died at 1:15 p.m. on [**2118-3-15**]. The patient's family declined a postmortem evaluation at this time.  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1.  Liver failure, 2.  Thrombosed portal vein. 3.  Esophageal varices. 4.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm status post abdominal aneurysm repair. 5.  Status post abdominal washouts. 6.  Status post Vicryl mesh closure of the abdomen and VAC placement. 7.

(Reference Range-Negative).  IMAGING: MRI Spine [**7-3**]: 1. Cervical anterior epidural collection, with severe narrowing of the thecal sac from C2 through C5, without evidence of spinal cord edema. Sagittal post-contrast images suggest that this collection contains fluid at the level of C2, which would indicate an abscess rather than a phlegmon. However, axial post-contrast images suggest that the central hypoenhancing portion of the collection at C2 may not be fully liquefied, or that the fluid may be highly viscous. 2. Anterior epidural collection from T11 through the upper sacrum, compressing the thecal sac and crowding the cauda equina. This collection appears to contain fluid from T12 through L3, indicative of an abscess rather than a phlegmon. 3. No evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis. 4. Bilateral posterior paravertebral muscle phlegmon at the level of L4-5 with a possible 5 mm abscess on the right. Contrast enhancement surrounding the L4-5 facet joints may represent inflammation secondary to the severe degenerative facet arthropathy, but septic facet arthropathy cannot be excluded  Echo [**7-4**]: IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild mitral leaflet thickening but without discrete vegetation or pathologic flow. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Normal left ventricular cavity size with preserved global and regional systolic function  MRI Spine [**7-4**]: 1. Cervical region: No STIR signal abnormality in the cord. No evidence of cord compression. Expected post-op changes. 2. Lumbar region: Small epidural signal abnormality, could represent residual abscess collection from debridement or post-surgical changes.  XRAY-Knee IMPRESSION: Small to moderate-sized knee joint effusion.  CTA [**7-9**] IMPRESSION: 1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology. 2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with subtotal lower lobe collapse. Evidence of loculated pleural effusions tracking up in the right upper lateral pleural space. 3. Multiple lung nodules likely infectious in this cl inical setting. Follow- up to resolution is recommended 4. No pneumothorax.  MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] [**8-12**] Significant increase in volume of the epidural fluid collection/abscess extending from the uppermost C1 epidural space to the inferior aspect of the study at L1, largest at the upper cervical spine where it measures approximately 1 cm in greatest thickness. The patient is status post cervical laminectomy from approximately C2-C6 but the epidural collection displaces the cervical cord posteriorly and the cervical cord appears compressed against the posterior ring of C1. There is increased signal within the cervical cord from the medulla to C3. 2. The epidural collection/abscess within the thoracic spine mildly displaces the thoracic cord without evidence of cord signal abnormality.  CT-Thoracentesis (drainage) [**7-13**] IMPRESSION: Successful diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis yielding 270 cc of serosanguineous fluid from the right pleural cavity. An 8 French pigtail catheter was placed within the pleural cavity and is currently attached to waterseal. Samples were sent for microbiology and chemistry per the ordering team's request.  MR C/T/L-Spine [**7-21**] IMPRESSION: 1. New soft tissue paraspinal pockets of fluid collection are seen in the lumbar region since the examination of [**2135-7-2**] and [**2135-7-4**], visualized in the lower lumbar region involving the psoas muscles and the erector spinae muscles. The largest collection in the right erector spinae muscle is approximately 3 cm and the largest collection in the right psoas muscle is approximately 2 cm. Additional left psoas muscle fluid pocket measures 2.8 cm. Smaller foci are also visualized. 2. Lumbar epidural fluid collection ventral and dorsal to the thecal sac in the lower lumbar region may be slightly smaller compared to [**2135-7-2**]. 3. Epidural collection in the cervical region extending from C2 inferiorly is not significantly changed since the MRI of [**2135-7-14**]. Minimal indentation on the spinal cord in cervical region is unchanged. Postoperative changes and laminectomies are seen in this region. 4. Thoracic epidural collection has not changed and there is no cord compression in thoracic region. 4. Laminectomies are seen in the lower thoracic/upper lumbar region. Thin rim of epidural collection again seen in the thoracic region which is unchanged. No cord compression is identified in the thoracic region.  CT-Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**7-26**] IMPRESSION:  1. Overall, stable appearance of multiple small fluid collection seen in the paraspinal muscles along with the erector spinae and psoas muscles, as described above. No new intraabdominal or intrapelvic collections identified. 2. Stable bilateral pleural effusion with bibasilar airspace disease. 3. Stable appearance of mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.  U/S Abdomen [**7-29**] IMPRESSION: 1. Cholelithiasis with edematous and thick walled but contracted gallbladder. No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of acute cholecystitis. Gallbladder wall thickening and edema may be caused by multiple factors such as liver disease and hypoalbuminemia, and clinical correlation is recommended. 2. Splenomegaly.  CT-Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**8-1**] IMPRESSION: 1. Multiple soft tissue abscesses appear similar to prior examination with erector spinae abscess on the right, left iliopsoas abscess, and fluid pockets overlying the lower lumbar spine spinous processes. 2. Left posterior rotator cuff region possible new abscess, not well seen on prior studies. 3. Bilateral basal pulmonary volume loss and consolidation, similar to prior examination in lesion addition to bilateral pleural effusions, more pronounced and somewhat loculated on the right but similar to prior study. 4. Nonspecific gallbladder wall thickening. Cholecystitis is not excluded, although the appearance is stable compared to prior examination and has been previously evaluated with ultrasound. 5. Nonspecific lesion in the right renal upper pole. This was not well seen on prior examination. If there is clinical suspicion for renal abscess, targeted ultrasound could be performed to further assess. 6. Left proximal thigh abscess, incompletely assessed but similar to prior study allowing for difference in technique. 7. Splenomegaly.  MRI C-Spine [**8-6**] IMPRESSION: Again, epidural enhancement and abscesses identified in the anterior cervical region. As described above, the fluid collection around C2-C3 level appears slightly increased in thickness, but the differences in measurements are small and this could also be due to partial volume averaging, but continued followup is recommended. Otherwise, the examination is stable  MRI T-Spine [**8-6**] IMPRESSION: Overall stable appearance of the thoracic spine compared to the previous MRI of [**2135-7-21**]. Again, lower thoracic and upper lumbar laminectomies and epidural enhancement is seen in the thoracic region without epidural abscess.  CT Scan Abd/Pelvis ([**8-9**]): with abdominal pain of unclear etiology, look for possible underlying abdominal abscess.  COMPARISON: CT torso from [**2135-8-1**].  TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast MDCT of the abdomen. The patient not received any oral or IV contrast.  FINDINGS: Of note, evaluation of abdominal organs is limited without any intravenous or oral contrast administered. Once again, there are bilateral pleural effusions with overlying collapse/consolidation that has slightly improved from previous study. Once again, the right is significantly greater than the left and appears loculated. A nodular density previously seen in the right middle lobe is not visualized in the current study.  CT ABDOMEN W/O Contrast: There is no focal liver lesion seen. There is evidence of a large stone within the gallbladder; however, there are no signs of gallbladder wall thickening or other associated signs to suggest inflammation or infection. The spleen is enlarged. There is no focal splenic lesion or abscess seen. Pancreas appears normal. Adrenals appear normal. The kidney is normal in appearance. Right kidney appears normal in appearance. The small area of hypoattenuation seen in the left kidney on the previous study was not appreciated on the current exam. Small periaortic and portacaval lymph nodes are again seen, however, they do not meet CT criteria for lymphadenopathy. There is no bowel obstruction. The appendix is normal. There is no significant mesenteric lymphadenopathy or fluid collection seen.  CT PELVIS W/O contrast: Once again seen is a low-attenuation fluid collection in the left iliopsoas muscle, extending from the lower lumbar-upper pelvic regions along the psoas. This collection appears unchanged, both in size and in character and further characterization is limited without contrast. Once again seen are the small areas of low attenuation, representing fluid in the proximal thigh as well as stranding in the left greater trochanter. This appears unchanged from the previous study of [**2135-8-1**]. There is no epidural abscess seen in the thoracic region.  The rectum, sigmoid colon, bladder, and uterus are normal.  3D reconstructions, coronal and sagittal reconstructions were essential in delineating the anatomy and pathology.  BONES: There is no osseous destruction seen. As mentioned, evidence of priorlaminectomies at the lower thoracic spine and upper lumbar spine are seen.There are no epidural collections suggestive of epidural abscess in the lumbaror visualized thoracic spine.  IMPRESSION: 1. Unchanged left iliopsoas abscess 2. Slight interval decrease in bilateral basal pulmonary volume loss and consolidation and pleural effusions. 3. Large gallstone within the gallbladder without sign of gallbladder inflammation. 4. Unchanged fluid collection in the left proximal thigh compared to prior. 5. This study was discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1169**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 4:30 p.m. on [**2135-8-9**]. . Unilateral upper extremity venous ultrasound. ([**8-17**]) COMPARISON: Upper extremity venous ultrasound [**2135-7-11**]. FINDINGS: Color and grayscale son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral subclavian and left-sided internal jugular, basilic, brachial and cephalic vessels were evaluated. Evaluated vessels demonstrated normal flow, compressibility and augmentation. There is a PICC line in the basilic. There is duplication of the brachial vessels. IMPRESSION: PICC in the basilic vein but no DVT. .   Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 54 yo female with no significant past medical history who initially presented with back pain, urinary retention on [**7-3**], found to have multiple epidural abscesses s/p multiple surgical debridements with hospital course complicated by episodes of flash pulmonary/respiratory compromise requiring intubation and febrile neutropenia secondary to lasix and vancomycin administration. . # Bacteremia/Abscesses/Antibiotic therapy . Patient initially presented with back pain, associated urinary retention and LE weakness. Admission imaging positive for cervical and lumbar epidural abscesses (though patient with no known risk factors). She was empirically started on vancomycin/cefepime/levofloxacin. She underwent C2-C6/T12-L2 bilateral laminectomies with insertion of 4 drains on [**2135-7-3**]. She subsequently developed a septic right knee and returned to the OR on [**2135-7-4**] for right knee washout. Regarding further initial infectious work-up at that time: a TEE was obtained which showed no vegetations; CT head without evidence of intracranial abscess. . On [**2135-7-6**], antibiotic coverage was narrowed to nafcillin when cultures from abscesses, right knee, and blood grew MSSA. However, due to signs and symptoms of leukocytosis, hypoxia there was concern for hospital acquired pneumonia and antibiotic coverage was broadened to vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin on [**7-10**]. Patient remained febrile. Surveillance imaging obtained on [**7-12**] which demonstrated increased epidural collection within anterior cervical epidural space and displacement of the cervical cord. The patient returned to the OR on [**7-13**] for abscess decompression and evacuation and fusion of C3-4, C4-5, and C5-6. After reviewing microbial date with all cultures + MSSA, her antibiotic coverage was again narrowed to nafcillin. . Patient had been doing well with normalized temperature and WBC however four days after starting nafcillin, developed a abdominal rash. Derm was consulted, biopsies were taken which were c/w drug rash secondary to nafcillin. Nafcillin was subsequently discontinued and replaced by IV vancomycin. . Repeat MR spine with new paraspinal fluid collections, and mild epidural fluid collection throughout the spine. Due to concern for continued infection cefepime was added to antibiotic regimen. On [**7-25**], the patient underwent paraspinal abscess drainage by interventional radiology. Follow-up CT torso was obtained on [**8-1**] due to persistent fevers on cefepime and vanc; finding were stable to previous imaging and cefepime was discontinued. On [**8-5**], her C-collar was removed. Surveilance MR C/T-Spine on [**8-6**] showed stable epidural enhancement and abscesses identified in the anterior cervical region, thoracic region without epidural abscess. CT scan on [**8-9**] demonstrated left iliopsoas abscess/phlegmen and left thigh fluid collection; both of which were too small to be drained by IR. . Unfortunately side effects necessitated further antibiotic adjustment. CBC with noted leukopenia on [**8-5**] with progression to neutropenia [**8-8**].  Out of concern that vancomycin could be contributing to decreasing counts, vanc d/c'ed  and IV daptomycin started. Per ID will plan to treat MSSA bacteremia/abscesses with IV daptomycin to total of 6-8wk course. At time of discharge utility of repeat imaging discussed. Plan to repeat CT abd/pelvis; MRI spine further into antibiotic treatment. . # Febrile Neutropenia . Patient's WBC count began to slowly decline on [**8-5**] with progression to neutropenia on [**8-8**]. Neutropenia was felt secondary to medication effect; subsequently omeprazole, furosemide, vancomycin and seroquel were discontinued. Hematology was consulted, and felt that furosemide or vancomycin were likely offending agents. Antibiotic coverage altered on [**8-8**]: vancomycin discontinued and daptomycin started for treatment of MSSA. On [**8-9**] she was febrile 102.6 and meropenem started for treatment of neutropenic fever. GCSF initiated. After administration of GCSF counts slowly became to rise and fevers abated. GCSF was stopped on [**8-14**] when ANC>1000 for more than 48hrs. . Respiratory Distress . On admission patient found to be tachypnic. LENIs negative. On [**7-8**], developed worsening tachypnea and hypoxemia (95% on 4L by nasal canula). The patient diureased 500ml on IV Lasix and improved slightly. CTA ruled out PE, however showed evidence of bilateral loculated pleural effusions and multiple lung nodules. Cardiac enzymes negative. Pro-BNP 2777 on [**7-8**]. Estimated EF by TEE was >55%; 2 repeat echos without evidence of valvular pathology. In MICU, IV Lasix and morphine lessened respiratory distress. On [**7-10**], transferred to the floor; latered became hypoxic and was transfered back to the MICU and started on BiPAP. Pleural effusion studies suggested parapneumonic effusion. Patient intubated and extubated several time while in MICU. On [**7-16**], the patient was again extubated. She developed hypertension to 180 SBP and respiratory distress secondary to pulm edema, which responded to lasix and labetolol. On [**7-19**], she was comfortable oxygenating with only nasal cannula. She was electively intubated on [**7-25**] for paraspinal abscess drainage and extubated post-procedure. Unfortunately, again developed worsening hypercarbic respiratory distress, requiring reintubation on [**7-27**].  She was gently diuresed, in an effort to decrease the work of breathing. On [**8-3**] she was succesfully extubated, satting well on face mask. On [**8-5**] she was weaned to NC. CT on [**8-9**] showed improvement in pleural effusions and basilar consolidations. She continued to do well on supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula. On the floor her oxygen requirement was weaned. She had one episode of flash pulmonary edema, during which she desaturated to high 80s. She was diuresed with bumex with good effect. For the remainder of her stay, team allowed for auto-diuresis. At time of discharge patient saturating 94% RA, >95% 1L. . # Blood Pressure . During MICU stay pt had repeated episodes of transient bradycardia and hypotension as well as episodes of paroxysmal hypertension into the SBP 180-200s. Her hypertension responded to 5mg-10mg doses of IV labetalol. After significiant diuresis, her SBP remained stable in the 150-160s. On the floor, BP ran consistently high. Patient was started on metoprolol and amlodipine. These medications were gradually uptitrated and at time of discharge pressures were better controlled on metoprolol 50mg TID, amlopidine 10mg QD. She was transitioned to toprol xl 150mg daily at the time of discharge. . # Nutrition . Patient underwent severeal video swallowing evaluation due to concern for silent aspiration. In the MICU, several methods of nutrition employed: NG tube feeds as well as PPN. On transfer to floor patient on NG tube feeds. Repeat speech and swallow on [**8-15**] demonstrated improved oral and pharyngeal swallow with continued swallow delay, premature spillover and reduced base of tongue retraction. Patient continued to aspirate thin liquids silently, but speech deemed it safe to initiate a PO diet of nectar thick liquids and moist, ground solids with the aspiration precautions documented below. It is important to note aspiration is silent, and she will need continued speech therapy follow up with likely repeat video swallow before advancing her diet.  # Delirium . In the MICU observed waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status worse at night and with spikes in fever. Symptoms improved with zyprexa at night. The pt became more alert following extubation on [**8-3**], however, she had some disorientation. She received several doses of seroquel, which was discontinued when the patient became neutropenic, as it can be a potential cause of leukopenia.  Over the course of the next few days, her became more alert and interactive.  By time of transfer from MICU to floor on [**8-10**], she was fully oriented and had a good understanding of the medical plan. On the floor, patients mentation continued to improve. At time of discharge patient mental status was clear and coherent. . # Elbow mass . Mass noted on right elbow.  Derm consulted; felt to be consistent with lipoma. . # UTI:  She developed low grade fevers on [**8-21**] to 100.4, prompting urinalysis, which demonstrated UTI.  She will complete a 10 day course of ciprofloxacin 500mg [**Hospital1 **] to end [**2135-9-1**].  Medications on Admission: None  Discharge Medications: . 1.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast - [**Location (un) 1110**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY Methicillin Sensitive Staph Aureus Bacteremia  SECONDARY Hypertension Anemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent   Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms [**Known lastname **] it was a pleasure taking care of you. . You were initially admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] due to symptoms of back pain. Upon imaging it was found that you had several abscesses throughout your spine as well as in your right knee. You underwent several surgeries to evacuate these infection and you were also started on antibiotics. Your antibiotic regimen was altered several times due to significant side effects. You experienced a rash after Nafcillin, and Vancomyocin was thought to contribute to low cell counts. You were placed on Daptomycin without side effect for a planned 8week course. A PICC line was placed prior to discharge to faciliate antibiotic administration as an outpatient. You will receive repeat imaging after completion of your antibiotic therapy for interval evaluation of infection. . Unfortunately, side effects from various medications prolonged your hospital course. It was thought that a combination of vancomycin and lasix contributed to decreased white blood cells (WBC). While your WBC counts were low you were placed on broad spectrum antibiotics to protect you from infection. We discontinued the medications we felt responsible for declining counts (lasix and vancomycin) and also administered a medication called Neupogen to increase WBC production. After several days of Neupogen treatment your white cell counts increased and stabilized. Neupogen as well as broad spectrum antibiotics were discontinued prior to discharge. . We also found your blood pressures to be elevated at times during your hospitalization. You were started on medications, metoprolol and amlodipine, to better control your blood pressure. . Regarding nutrition, after extubation you were noted to have difficultly swallowing. Speech and swallow was consulted and after several attempts you completed and passed your evaluation. After completion, you were started on a thickened nectar liquid regimen and a soft, ground solid diet. You will need repeat speech and swallow evaluation at rehab. . CHANGES TO YOUR MEDICATIONS. On arrival to the hospital you were no prescription medications. . MEDICATIONS WE STARTED . --To treat your infection we STARTED Daptomycin 600mg IV Q24 (start date: [**2135-7-26**], stop date: [**2135-9-19**] (total 8 weeks)) . --To treat PAIN we STARTED: 1. FENTANYL 25 mcg/hr Patch, which can be reapplied every 72 hr; 2. Two LIDOCAINE 5 %(700 mg/patch) Adhesive Patchs, Apply each Adhesive Patch daily to back 3. ACETAMINOPHEN 325 mg Tablet; you can take 1-2 tablets by mouth every 6 hours. . --To treat your high blood pressure we started: 1. AMLODIPINE 10mg daily; you will take two 5mg tablets daily 2. Metoprolol succinate (toprol XL) 150mg tablet daily . -- To prevent blood clot formation while you heal and are relatively limited in your movement you will continue to receive: Heparin (Porcine)  5,000 unit/mL Solution  Injections three times a day . --To help treat your anxiety we started: 1. Lorazepam  0.5 mg Tablet, you can take one 0.5 tablet by mouth at at bedtime as needed for anxiety. .

History of Present Illness: The patient is a 52-year old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer, s/p lt. mastectomy now enrolled in clinical trial ""05-395"" (lapatinib monotherapy 1500 mg), who noted lt. arm swelling [**2-28**]. Doppler neg for clot, but CT (routine, restaging) revealed pericardial effusion. Echo [**3-3**] revealed: small to moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion, most prominently inferolateral to the left ventricle and around the right atrium, but ~1cm anterior to the right ventricle. There is mild right ventricular diastolic collapse consistent with increased pericardial pressure/early tamponade physiology. . [**3-5**]: Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-3-3**], the pericardial effusion appears similar to slightly larger. There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology. . [**3-7**]: There is subtle RV diastolic compression without collapse (no overt tamponade). Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-3-5**], there is slightly less pericardial fluid anteriorly. Otherwise no change. . A pericardial drain was placed with return of approximately 250 cc of serosanginous fluid and normalization of right heart pressures. She is admitted to the CCU for further monitoring.  Past Medical History: ONCOLOGY HISTORY: She was initially diagnosed in [**2164**] with a 3.5 cm infiltrating ductal carcinoma, lymph node positive, LVI positive, ER positive.

Cardiac Cath Supplies Used: - [**Company **], PERICARDIOSENTISIS SET - ALLEGIANCE, CUSTOM STERILE PACK   COMMENTS: 1. Resting hemodynamics were performed. The right sided filling pressures were mildly elevated (mean RA pressure was 12mmHg and RVEDP was 12mmHg). The pulmonary artery pressures were mildly elevated  measuring 35/15mmHg. The left sided filling pressures were equalized to the right (mean PCW pressure was 12mmHg). There was significant respiratory variation of systemic arterial pressure up to 20mmHg. There was equalization of RA and pericardial pressures. 2. Pericardiocentesis was performed under fluoroscopy guidance. Pericardial drain was subsequently placed with 240cc serosanguinous fluid removed. Repeat measurement of pericardial pressure and RA  pressure demonstrated clear seperation.   FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Elevated right sided filling pressures with equlization of RA/LA/pericardial pressures. 2. Successful placement of pericardial drain. . ECHO Study Date of [**2177-3-10**] Conclusions: Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-3-7**], there is now minimal residual pericardial effusion. . ECG Study Date of [**2177-3-10**]  1:00:10 PM Sinus rhythm Normal ECG Since previous tracing, no significant change . CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2177-3-11**] IMPRESSION: AP chest, small right pleural effusion is present. Right lower lobe atelectasis is new since [**2-28**]. Consolidation in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe and a right apical paramediastinal mass are unchanged. Left lung is clear. Several loops of pericardiocentesis catheter projecting over the subxiphoid midline, the base of the heart and superiorly to the level of the pulmonary outflow tract, are acutely coiled and should be evaluated clinically to see if they are draining properly. No pneumothorax. . ECHO Study Date of [**2177-3-11**] Conclusions: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion primarily inferolateral to the left ventricle with minimal effusion anterior to the right ventricle. No echocardiographic signs of tamponade physiology are seen. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-3-10**], the  inferolateral effusion is more prominent. .

Pericardial effusion. Likely malignant. Pericardiocentesis was performed with approximately 250 cc of serosanguinous fluid output and normalization of right heart pressures. A pericardial drain was placed with 320 cc of serosanguinous fluid output the first 12 hours, then 75 cc over 6 hours, then no output. A repeat echocardiogram showed a small pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade as above. The pericardial drain was removed. An echocardiogram the next morning showed stable small pericardial effusion. Cultures were negative at the time of discharge and cytology was pending. The patient will have a repeat echocardiogram five days after discharge and will follow-up with her oncologist. The patient may need a pericardial window or balloon pericardiotomy procedure if the effusion increases in size. . 2. Infectious disease. The patient had a temperature to 100.8 the second day of admission. The patient's only localizing symptom was a nonproductive cough the patient has complained of for the past three weeks, overall improved since that time. Chest x-ray showed atelectasis but no new consolidations. Urinalysis negative for infection. Urine, blood, and pericardial fluid cultures without growth at the time of discharge. The fever was likely secondary to atelectasis or the patient's underlying malignancy. . 3. Breast cancer. The patient is now off the lapatinib study. The patient is followed by oncology. . 4. Anemia. The patient's hematocrit remained stable at 31-36 during admission. The patient's iron studies showed an iron to TIBC ratio of 5%, although ferritin was within normal limits. Folate and B12 were within normal limits. Further management deferred to the patient's primary physician.  Medications on Admission: Simvastatin 20 mg QD  Discharge Medications: 1.

There is no pneumothorax. Right pleural effusion including a fissural component is chronic. No pulmonary edema. Heart size is top normal. Right infusion port catheter ends in the mid SVC. Presence of small pulmonary nodules would be obscured by the extensive overlying pleural abnormalities.  [**2199-9-6**] Liver/ Gallbladder US: 1. Mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation, though with common bile duct within normal limits in size. MRCP could be performed to assess for relationship of hepatic metastases to intrahepatic ducts if intervention is planned.  2. Multiple known hepatic metastasis is incompletely evaluated on this study.  3. Layering sludge within the gallbladder.  4. Small amount of intra-abdominal ascites.  [**2199-9-6**]: Right Femoral US: Pseudoaneurysm of the right common femoral artery. Size has slightly increased from 1.7 to 1.9 mm in the sagittal plane only.  [**2199-9-2**]: CT Abdomen/Pelvis: 1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma. 2. Right nephrostomy tube in stable position. Similar extent of mild left hydronephrosis and hydroureter. Retained contrast within the left kidney, likely from recent CT two days prior, is compatible with obstructive nephropathy. 3. Similar extent of bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis and right middle lobe collapse. 4. Metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma with unchanged omental and hepatic metastases. 5. Increased anasarca, pulmonary edema, and size of abdominal ascites, suggestive of volume overload.  [**2199-8-31**]: ECHO The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.  IMPRESSION: No left ventricular thrombus seen. Normal global biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary hypertension.  [**2199-8-30**] MRI HEAD: MPRESSION: Multiple small acute infarcts are identified in both parietooccipital lobes and cerebellar hemispheres without definite acute infarct within the brainstem. Small vessel disease and brain atrophy.  [**2199-8-30**]: CT Head and Neck: 1. Thrombosis of the basilar artery. Possible perfusion defects concerning for infarct within the brainstem; however, CT perfusion is suboptimal for the evaluation of the posterior circulation. MRI could be performed for further evaluation.  2. Extensive focal atherosclerosis with marked narrowing of the left subclavian artery just proximal to the takeoff of the left vertebral artery.  No other areas of significant stenosis or aneurysm formation are seen.   Brief Hospital Course: #. Basilar stroke: Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2199-8-30**] for acute stroke. He was treated with MERCI and intra-arterial TPA: The patient's neuro status was closely monitored. He was transitioned from a heparin gtt to lovenox given recent embolic stroke and hypercoaguable state in setting of malignancy.  The patient was cleared for a regular diet after a speech and swallow evaluation.  #. Right common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm: Patient s/p mechanical and chemical thrombectomy via right common femoral artery puncture, and was found to have small right common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm. He had a repeat ultrasound on [**2199-9-6**] which showed the pseudoaneurysm had slightly increased in size from 1.7 to 1.9 mm in the sagittal plane only. Vascular surgery was following, and did not feel there was a need for intervention.  The patient's HCT remained stable.  #. Hypoxia: Likely secondary to pleural effusions (malignant). CXR on [**2199-9-3**] had shown stable reticular nodular pattern in right lung likely representing lymphatic obstruction, a stable right pleural effusion, and increased opacification in left lung likely representing increased atelectasis and increased pleural effusion. The patient's supplemental O2 was gradually weaned as tolerated.  Repeat CXR on [**2199-9-8**] showed increased pleural effusion and patient had a repeat thoracentesis on [**2199-9-11**] prior to discharge. A post-procedure chest x-ray was done and there were no complications from the procedure.  #. [**Last Name (un) **]: Patient has h/o bilateral hydronephrosis, likely secondary to obstructive uropathy. s/p right nephrostomy tube in 08/[**2198**]. Prior to this admission, the patient had been scheduled for bilateraly stent placement on [**2199-9-12**]. His left stent showed hematuria and had poor output in setting of creatinine increase from 1.3->1.7, his left nephrostomy tube was placed. On discharge, his creatinine was 2.0. This lab test should be repeated.  #. Stage IV gastric CA: Patient recently diagnosed with gastric cancer, and gastric biopsy returned positive for poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma infiltrating through the deep mucosal layer. Cytology from the peripancreatic lymph nodes was also positive for malignant cells consistent with adenocarcinoma. Patient started first cycle of chemotherapy with epirubicin, oxaliplatin and capecitabine on [**2199-8-22**]. Given recent complications in course, chemo currently on hold.  His cell counts were monitored closely in setting of recent chemo.  #. Atrial Fibrillation: Patient rate-controlled with metoprolol. Coumadin had been held initially for thoracentesis, and was not restarted in setting of stroke and low platelet count. Patient was previously on argatroban gtt, but placed on heparin gtt after rise in platelets and exclusion of HIT. Patient will need long-term anticoagulation in setting of recent embolic stroke and hypercoagulable state.  He was started on lovenox.  #. Hypertension: BP was well-controlled after transfer to medical oncology service. The patient was continued on metoprolol for both rate control and BP control.

Briefly this is a 79yo patient with PMH significant for HTN, CAD, s/p CABG being transferred from the ICU for probable angioedema after taking lisinopril. . Patient had been giving script for lisinopril a while back but only started taking it on Friday [**8-24**] AM. He started to feel his lips, tongue and face swelling and it progressivly worsened to include his throat. He was admitted to the ICU and was intubated and sedated. ENT saw patient and recommended keeping tube in place. However, patient self-extubated overnight and actually remained stable. His condition improved and he was transferred to the floor for further care. . On arrival to the medical floor, patient was stable. Vital signs- T 96.5, HR 74, BP 125/64, R 14, satting 100% on 4L.

Angioedema Pt was admitted to the ICU and was intubated and sedated.  He was also started on IV steroids, H2 blockers, and benadryl.  ENT saw patient and recommended keeping 6 mm tube in place. However, patient self-extubated overnight and actually remained stable.  His condition improved and he was transferred to the floor for further care on [**2164-8-26**].  He was initially on 4L NC and satting in high 90s and this was quickly weaned.  He experienced some soreness of the throat and had a difficult time swallowing pills at first.  ENT saw him and thought this was due to trauma from the ET tube and not lingering angioedema.  As his angioedema improved he was able to tollerate first thick liquids, then a regular diet.  He was switched to PO steroids with a 7 day taper starting on [**8-27**].  2. Acute on chronic kidney injury - baseline 2.6. creatinine was 3.2 on admission but this trended back down to 2.4 by D/C. Allopurinol was held in the ICU given Cr bump.  3. HTN- Antihypertensives were held in ICU but amlodipine was restarted once stable on the medicine floor.  4. CHF.

Patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital on [**2165-4-16**] for chest and abdominal pain. He ruled out for an MI with cardiac biomarkers and was felt to be constipated as was illustrated on CT and thought to be due to chronic narcotic use for lower back pain and right hip pain (awaiting hip replacement). His constipation was treated aggressively with medications and disimpaction with minimal effect. On day 4 of his hospitalization, he was febrile to 104 with a leukocytosis to 14 and was pan-cultured while Vancomycin and Zosyn were started empirically with specific concern for a PIV infection suggested by surrounding erythema and edema. Blood cultures later grew GPCs in [**2-23**] bottles and chronic foot ulcers were swabbed and reportedly grew staph aureus with pending sensitivities. Zosyn was thus discontinued. In the setting of infection, patient became delirious, noted to be attempting to grab things from the air and talking to people in the room. Of note, patient was continued on narcotics, reportedly at the wife's insistence given concern for narcotic withdrawal. Neurology was consulted and recommended a head CT which was unremarkable, leaving them to conclude that the mental status was toxic/metabolic in the setting of infection and narcotic use. He was started on Ceftriaxone 2 grams daily for CNS coverage though no LP was performed. On day 5, patient was noted to develop acute renal failure with a creatinine of 3, up from 1.3 and was also anuric. CKs were checked to evaluate renal failure from rhabdomyolysis and were not likely contributing at a level of 361. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for concern of his renal failure progressing to the point of needing HD, since [**Hospital3 77641**] no HD facilities. . Upon arrival, patient was noted to vomit and had reportedly vomited in route to [**Hospital1 18**]. He additionally started experiencing low-amplitude, rhythmic clonus of his hands and legs, became transiently hypoxic and was not verbally responsive. There was concern for seizing and patient was urgently intubated to protect his airway. Discussion with the patient's wife, [**Name8 (MD) **] RN, revealed that the patient has never had a seizure disorder and does not drink alcohol. Additionally, he had a CT scan with contrast at [**Hospital1 2025**] 3 days prior to his admission to [**Hospital3 **]as a part of his RCC work-up and the wife expressed concern for contrast-induced nephropathy. Patient was then ordered for a stat head CT given the mental status and neurology was consulted for further assistance with management.

[**2165-4-21**] CXR: ET tube tip at the thoracic inlet is approximately 45 mm from the carina, standard position. Lung volumes are low and there are several areas of plate-like atelectasis. Heart size borderline enlarged. Pleural effusion, if any, is minimal. No pneumothorax.  [**2165-4-21**] Abd XR: Diffuse colonic dilatation without air within the rectum. This may represent ileus. Close followup is recommended.  [**2165-4-21**] Left foot XR: The patient is status post partial amputation of the first through fifth metatarsals and resection of multiple phalanges. Portions of the 1st distal phalanx, the toe of the second (?) digit, and the fifth toe are present. There is a focus of air overlying the surgical bed of the first ray, representing either air within an area of ulceration or subcutaneous emphysema. There is relative lucency of the adjoining portion of the first metatarsal bony remnant suspicious for osteomyelitis. Correlation with any previous (outside) radiographs and history of recent debridement is recommended for full assessment. The posterior calcaneus is obscured by overlying material and not fully evaluated on this examination.  [**2165-4-22**] CT head: No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.  [**2165-4-22**] EEG: This is an abnormal portable EEG recording due to the pattern of widespread alpha range activity alternating with relative suppression of the background without reactivity which is suggestive of an alpha coma pattern. This abnormality suggests a severe encephalopathy. Medications and metabolic disturbances may be causes but this pattern can also be seen in post-anoxic patients. There were no lateralized or epileptiform features seen and no electrographic seizures were seen in this recording.  [**2165-4-22**] Renal U/S: No evidence of hydronephrosis.  [**2165-4-22**] TTE: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild cavity enlargement and preserved global  biventricular systolic function.  [**2165-4-25**] TEE: No intracardiac mass or vegetations. No significant valvular regurgitation. Complex, mobile atheroma in descending aorta, simple atheroma in the aortic arch.  [**2165-4-25**] MRI/MRV Head w/o Contrast: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of acute infarction. 2. Patent major dural venous sinuses. Decreased signal in the posterior part of the superior sagittal sinus, including the torcular herophili and the right sigmoid sinus, likely relates to slow flow rather than thrombosis given the lack of increased signal on the sagittal T1-weighted sequences. If there is continued concern based on the clinical presentation, CTA and CTV, if serum creatinine level is appropriate or a followup MR venogram can be considered.  [**2165-4-30**] CT SPINE: IMPRESSION: Limited study due to patient habitus and motion, and non- myelographic technique, with: 1. No definite epidural or subdural abscess collection seen in the thoracolumabr spine. 2. Apparent hyperdense focus in the ventral epidural space at the T2 level, most likely artifactual. If this remains of clinical concern, follow-up CT study, dedicated CT- myelography or MRI, when feasible, might be helpful for further evaluation. N.B. The patient successfully underwent MRI of the brain (at this institution) as recently as [**2165-4-25**]. 3. No fracture or malalignment. 4. Mild spondylosis of the thoracolumbar spine, with no canal compromise. 5. Small bilateral pleural effusions and moderate bibasilar consolidations; differential diagnosis includes atelectasis, aspiration and bacterial pneumonia.  [**2165-5-2**] Renal U/S: IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis and no perinephric collections seen in this very limited mobile renal ultrasound study.  [**2165-5-9**] IMPRESSION:  1. Definite abnormal focus of tracer accumulation in the left foot correlating with known sites of ulceration/infection.  2. Indeterminate foci in the right proximal thigh medially or scrotum and the soft-tissues of the left knee medially, for which clinical correlation is needed.  3. Possible nasal infection or ethmoid sinusitis.  [**2165-5-13**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to a slow and poorly modulated background indicative of a mild to moderate encephalopathy. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infections are among the most common causes. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing although encephalopathies can obscure focal findings. There were no epileptiform discharges noted.    Brief Hospital Course: 55 year old male had prolonged hospital course complicated by multiple infections, mental status changes, and renal failure who requires long term antibiotic therapy.  # Sepsis/Meningitis:  He was transferred from [**Location (un) **] in the setting of high-grade MSSA bacterimia and mental status changes, and intubated on arrival because of question seizures and concern for airway protection.  Before speciation returned, he was initially managed with vancomycin and zosyn, and then switched to nafcillin given MSSA.  He also required pressors intermittently on the day after presenting but this was ultimately thought to represent a low-baseline blood pressure, and pressors were subsequently discontinued, with MAPs that remained greater than 65.  The source of his infection was unclear but thought to be secondary to left foot ulcers, which also grew MSSA.  This was evaluated by podiatry and vascular, and he was found to have osteomyelitis of the first toe, and would possibly need L BKA for definitive treatment. There was also concern for encephalopathy given his worsening mental status prior to and after transfer, and neurology was consulted. An LP was initially deferred because of the unlikelihood of him developing meningitis during his hospitalization at [**Location (un) **], as he did not initially present with symptoms suggestive of this condition.  However, it was later performed and was consistent with bacterial meningitis, and antibiotics were changed to vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir.  ACV and CTX were then discontinued as CSF culture returned negative and other cultures continued to be MSSA.  He was extubated after 10 days and tolerate this well.  Vancomycin was continued following transfer to floor.  A thorough work up for source of infection, including LP and left foot imaging, did not yield a source.  As patient continued to improve clinically, the decision was made to treat empirically with vancomycin until [**6-5**], dosing during HD.  # Altered mental status: After extubation, patient was delirious, not responding to commands, and with jerking motions of his head.  An MRI/MRV was negative for structural abnormality on [**2165-4-25**], after EEG showed possible alpha-coma waves.  His mental status cleared after 4 days extubation suggesting ICU narcosis.  He began to follow commands on [**2165-5-4**].  Following transfer to floor, fentanyl patch was discontinued in favor of morphine PO.  The patient's mental status continued to improve without further intervention.  At time of discharge, patient was oriented to time, person, and place.  # ? hypodense region in TT2 area of spinal cord:  Intial concern was for abscess with cord compression as patient was febrile with MSSA infection and not moving his lower extremities for several days pre-extubation [**2165-4-30**].  Neurosurgery was consulted and recommended CT myelogram or MRI to better define this lesion.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (radiology) stated CT myelogram was not indicated and suggested MRI.  Mr. [**Known lastname 77642**] was unable to fit in the MRI scanner far enough to scan his spine so he was watched clinically and improved. Consider f/u MRI in open MRI scanner as an outpatient.  # Respiratory failure:  He was intubated shortly after ariving at [**Hospital1 18**] because of concern for airway protection in the setting of question seizures, as he had low-amplitude clonic movements of his hands and legs. His vent settings were weaned and plan for extubation on [**5-1**] was moved up after he bit through the tubing to inflate the cuff.  He was extubated after 9 days and his respiratory status continue to improve.  EEG obtained showed no epileptiform activity.  Patient had stable respiratory for the duration of his hospitalization following extubation.  # Acute Renal Failure: His creatinine began rising prior to transfer from a baseline of 1.3, and he developed oliguric renal failure.  Renal was consulted and their analysis of his urine was consistent with ATN secondary to sepsis, though there was no clear documentation of hypotension from the OSH.  He had to be started on HD ([**2165-4-26**]) for volume overload and hyperkalemia. At that point his creatinine was 9.8. He continued on HD and eventually a temporary dialysis catheter was placed (on [**5-2**])and the femoral HD catheter was pulled. His urine output improved, although his need for HD continued.  The patient had another dialysis catheter placed on [**5-15**] for HD, with subsequent self-removal secondary to agitation.  A tunnelled catheter HD line was placed on [**2165-5-17**] for resumption of HD.  The patient continued receiving HD 3 times weekly on the floor, and pt's creatinine was 2.2 at time of discharge.  The patient will continue HD following discharge and will be followed by the nephrology service.  # Hypertension: After septic picture resolved, patient was hypertensive to 200s/80s.  His losartan was held for renal protection in hopes that his renal function would recover.  He was started on metoprolol and hydralizine with better control. Pt's HTN was managed well on the floor following ICU transfer with the current medication regimen at discharge.  # L foot ulcer: Likely seeding to blood causing sepsis. ESR and CRP very high and will monitor with Abx treatment for osteomyelitis. - Podiatry and vascular surgery were consulted and stated they would defer amputation and await stabilization/abx treatment of patient prior to surgery. - no intervention was pursued, as patient improved clinically on floor on vancomycin - pt will have ID follow up on [**6-5**]  # Right hip OA: significant source of pain and had required large doses of narcotics prior to admission.  Per family, the plan was to replace his hip, but he was battling recurrent infections from L toe delaying this.  Morphine PO with scheduled tylenol proved an effective regimen for his pain.  # Large bowel obstruction:  A KUB demonstrated a distended transverse colon concerning for ileus in the setting of large narcotic use for R hip pain.  General surgery was consulted and felt that it was improving and did not require surgical intervention. He eventually began stooling again after PO narcan was started and with an aggressive bowel regimen.  Following transfer to floor, constipation resolved with bowel regimen and change in opiate use.  # CAD s/p IMI: Ruled out for MI at OSH and was continued on ASA/plavix.  He was not on a beta blocker or statin at home for unclear reasons.  # DM:  Managed initially with an insulin drip because of elevated finger sticks and converted to a sliding scale.  [**Last Name (un) **] consulted and placed patient on a basal bolus regimen with good control at time of discharge.  This regimen will be continued at rehab.  # Renal Cell Carcinoma: Is seen at [**Hospital1 2025**].  Per family, he was recently diagnosed ~2 cm mass, CT torso without mets.  He was scheduled for cryoablation prior to this hospitalization.  # Gout:  Renally-dosed Allopurinol and then d/c'd given renal failure.  # Communication: [**Name (NI) **] wife, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 77643**] - cell  # Patient was made DNR, but okay to re-intubate for respiratory failure post-extubation.

Patient states she had been feeling constipated for 1 week after chemo on [**6-6**] and then took laxatives until she had several large BMs. A few days later she develope large volume, non-bloody dairrhea that was associated with some lightheadedness. She denied fevers, chills, rashes. Reports poor appetite but states she was drinking lot of water and trying to eat salty foods; however this was limited by worsening mucositis over the past few days. Due to concern for dehydration and contniued diarrhea, the patient was admitted directly from the oncology clinic. . Upon arrival to the floor, pt AF with BP 120/74, HR 116, RR 24, O2 sat 94% 2L NC. She was given 2L IVFs, started on po flagyl empirically for c. diff adn had stool cultures sent for possible OIs. Upon vitals check at 0400, pt's BP noted to be 78/54, HR 98, RR 20s, O2 sat 86% RA --> 93% 3L NC. Given 500 cc IVF bolus X 2 with response in SBP to 86/40s, however, RR rose to upper 20-30s with O2 sats 90% 6L NC --> 95% NRB. ABG 7.51/25/114/21. CXR revealed likely pulmonary edema with worsening bilateral pleural effusions and possible retrocardiac opacity. She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where code status was confirmed as full and pt was intubated. Peri-intubation required dopamine at 20 mcg/kg/min, which was transitioned over to levophed gtt once triple lumen catheter placed.  Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 1617**] was previously treated for breast cancer in the late [**2153**]. At that time she was diagnosed with a left-sided infiltrating ductal carcinoma on [**2160-7-30**]. Repeat biopsy showed persistent DCIS, and she underwent left mastectomy on [**2160-9-20**]. Two of three lymph nodes were involved. She was treated with 6 cycles of adjuvant oral CMF chemotherapy, which completed in [**2161**], and then eight years of tamoxifen as the tumor was ER positive, PR negative. Since that time Ms. [**Known lastname 1617**] was also diagnosed with a left renal cell carcinoma and underwent partial nephrectomy in 03/[**2178**]. Her medical course has been complicated by coronary artery disease status post MI in [**9-/2179**] and atrial fibrillation. More recently, a CT of the chest noted ground-glass abnormalities, raising concern for bronchoalveolar carcinoma. This has not been biopsied or formally diagnosed. In [**2-/2182**] liver function studies were noted to be elevated, and liver ultrasound and abdominal CT showed numerous lesions in the liver. CT-guided core liver biopsy on [**2182-2-25**] showed metastatic breast adenocarcinoma staining positive for mammoglobin, negative for GCDFP, ER, and PR. The tumor overexpressed HER-2/neu. Tumor markers drawn on [**2182-2-18**] were elevated with CEA 20 ng/mL and CA 27.29 278 u/mL. PET scan performed on [**2182-3-6**] showed numerous heterogeneous liver lesions, sclerotic lesions in the left anterior rib and right ilium that were FDG avid and concerning for metastatic foci, and FDG avid left pelvic side wall lymph node. On [**2182-3-20**] mammogram and ultrasound of the right breast showed a 1.9-cm right breast nodule. Pathology from a core breast biopsy showed invasive ductal carcinoma grade I that was HER-2/neu negative and ER/PR positive. Ms. [**Known lastname 1617**], therefore, appears to have a new right breast tumor that is ER/PRpositive, HER-2/neu negative, and liver metastases that are ER/PR negative and HER-2/neu positive. She began Herceptin on [**2182-4-16**], and Navelbine was added on [**2182-6-6**]. Also had L thoracocentesis in [**5-11**] with malignant cells (adenocarcinoma) on cytology. .

Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2182-3-19**], biventricular systolic funciton is now significantly depressed.  . RADIOLOGY: LLE U/S: IMPRESSION: No evidence of left lower extremity DVT. . CXR: Comparison is made with prior study [**2182-5-10**]. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. Mild left pleural effusion has increased. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged. There is mild pulmonary edema. There is atelectasis in the right lower lobe. Multiple surgical clips are in the left upper quadrant abdomen. There is no pneumothorax.  Brief Hospital Course: In short, Ms [**Known lastname 1617**] is a 76F with h/o metastatic breast CA C1D15 of navelbine/herceptin admitted with diarrhea and weakness, transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in septic shock, expired [**2-4**] overwhelming GNR bacteremia. . # Septic shock: overwhelming GNR bacteremia w cardiogenic/distributive/hypovolemic components in the setting of febrile neutropenia. DDx for the infection included the gut (given diarrhea) vs the lung vs other. Pt treated w aggressive fluid resuscitation, dopamine, norepinepherine and vasopressin pressors, broad-spectrum antibiotics. TTE revealed decreased LVEF confirming the suspicion of acute heart failure in the setting of sepsis. . # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Hypoxia progressed relatively rapidly in the setting of receiving IVFs, CXR with evidence supporting pulmonary edema. Furthermore, pt's known malignant pleural effusion appears to be worsening and is also likely contributing. No known aspiration events. Given neutropenia and other vitals concerning for sepsis, infection also remains on differential. PE also considered, but less likely. Treated for sepsis as above. . # Hyponantremia: Na 120, improved to 130 w fluid resuscitation. Does have prior h/o hyponatremia. Suspect that hypovolemia is primary etiology. . # Diarrhea: Possibly infectious etiology given neutropenia vs could be [**2-4**] chemo. Given refractory hypotension in the setting of sepsis, possibly developing ischemic colitis. . # Pancytopenia: likely [**2-4**] chemotherapy - neutropenic, anemic w underlying combined iron-deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease. No evidence of hemolysis. Thrombocytopenia. Transfused w pRBCs and FFP. . # Metastatic breast CA: With known mets to liver and likely to lung and bone based off of PET scan and pleural fluid cytology. . # Atrial fibrillation: INR supratherapeutic on admission.

The procedure was without complications. She was closely monitored in the PACU and then transferred to the ICU for ongoing gas exchange issues related to baseline emphysema and diastolic heart failure. She was transferred to the floor for further monitoring on POD #2 in stable condition. We continue to monitor her breathing pattern and gas exchange diuresing her with lasix to maintain a negative fluid balance to treat her acute on chronic diastolic CHF exacerbation post surgery. Her diet was gradually advanced.  She worked with physical therapy who recommended rehab. On POD # 7 she had an episode of hypotensive causing ischemic colitis which was treated with fluid/albumin.  By POD #9 her abdominal pain resolved and she started to tolerate on a regular diet.   She was discharged to rehab on POD # 13 in stable condition.  Follow-up has been arranged with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one week.  1.Peripheral Arterial Disease sp  bilateral ileofemoral endarterectomies with patch angioplasty and bilateral iliac stents on [**2191-3-3**] for disabling claudication. Dopplerable LE pulses. Groin incisions are clean, slightly red and should be covered with DSD until removal at followup appointment next week.  2.Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure She had acute exacerbation of her chronic congestive heart failure after her procedure which we closely monitored and treated with lasix as needed.  She is on her home dose of lasix 40mg daily.  Her PREOP WEIGHT is 77.1 kg.  TODAY'S WEIGHT is 85.7 kg.  We have been unable to diurese secondary to hypotension and ischemic colitis.  3.Ischemic Colitis On POD #7 she had an episode of hypotension to the 70's after lasix administration. At that time, our goal was 1 liter negative a day. Shortly after this episode, she had vomitting with diarrhea with LUQ abdominal pain.  Her lactate level was 3.1 and her wbc rose to 23.3 from 7.6 earlier in the day. She was aggressively resusitate her with fluid and albumin. An Abd CT did not show any overt mesenteric ischemia. Flexible sigmoidoscopy, to evaluate mucosa, was negative for ischemia. Cdiff was also negative.  She was started on vanco/cipro/flagyl. She had continued improvement with return of her WBC to normal and resumption of a regular diet by POD #9.  4.Hypertension BP now 120's/80.  WE HAVE NOT RESTARTED HER HOME ANTIHYPERTENSIVES/CARDIAC MEDS of amlodipine 5mg, diltiazem HCl XR 360mg or moexipril 15mg secondary to relative hypotension (90s systolic) in the setting of presumed bowel ischemia.

Chemistry-7 showed an initial creatinine of 4.2 with a potassium of 6.7.  After gentle fluids and treatment for his potassium, he had a repeat potassium of 5.7 and a creatinine of 3.9.  He had an alanine-aminotransferase of 57, his aspartate aminotransferase was 166, his alkaline phosphatase was 101, and his total bilirubin was 3.7.  PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm.  There were no peaked T waves. Otherwise, his electrocardiogram was normal.  BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted for his acute renal insufficiency.  His Lasix and his Aldactone were held.  His hyperkalemia responded well to his Kayexalate therapy.  The patient was noted to have some mild periorbital erythema and edema on the right side of his face.  He was initially started on doxycycline for this presumed preseptal cellulitis.  The patient's creatinine did initially improve; however, it started to increase again slowly during the course of his hospital stay.  Initially, it was felt that the patient's initial presentation of acute renal insufficiency was secondary to aggressive diuresis; however, in the setting of his diuretics being held and his continued increase in his creatinine, it was possible that he could have the initial stages of hepatorenal syndrome.  The patient has had elevated creatinines on previous hospitalizations, presumed to be related to hepatorenal syndrome.  The patient was started on octreotide and midodrine.  Also in the setting of his acute renal insufficiency, his tetracycline was held as it was possible that this could be a contributing factor.  An Ophthalmology consultation was obtained which showed just some very mild preseptal cellulitis with no orbital signs or symptoms suggestive of an orbital cellulitis.  The patient's doxycycline was discontinued in favor of Keflex.  The patient did have urine eosinophils and sediment checked. He had bland sediment which was not consistent with an acute tubular necrosis type picture.  The patient was also transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells for a low hematocrit early on during the course of his hospital stay. The patient did not have any upper endoscopy as his anemia was not suspected to be secondary to esophageal varices.  The patient's creatinine continued to rise in the setting of his octreotide and midodrine therapy.  Because of this, albumin 25 grams intravenously once per day was also started.  On [**2138-3-29**], the patient became encephalopathic.  Blood cultures and urine cultures were sent, and he did have an episode of occult-blood positive stools.  In the setting of his encephalopathy, his renal function did improve; however, he was transferred to the Unit for further observation.  A nasogastric lavage was done in the setting of his occult-blood positive stool.  The nasogastric lavage was negative for blood.  He did have a STAT head computed tomography which was negative for bleed.  All sedatives were discontinued, and he was started on lactulose therapy.  A chest x-ray there was negative for a pneumonia.  The patient did have serial blood cultures done.  He did have a total of [**6-26**] blood cultures positive for methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus.  His mental status did improve on lactulose therapy.  The origin of his staphylococcal bacteremia was still uncertain.  In this setting, he did have a diagnostic paracentesis done which was negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.  The patient was started on vancomycin for his high-grade bacteremia.  He did have a transesophageal echocardiogram done which was negative for endocarditis.  Per the Infectious Disease staff, it was recommended that he be treated with four to six weeks of vancomycin from the date of his last positive blood cultures which were [**2138-3-30**].  The patient was transferred back to the floor with an improved mental status and improved renal function.  He did well on the floor.  His hematocrit remained stable.  He remained afebrile on vancomycin.  The patient also completed a course of levofloxacin for his preseptal cellulitis.   For his preseptal cellulitis, he received a total of 10 days of antibiotics which included doxycycline, Keflex, and levofloxacin.  The patient did have good nutritional intake while on the floor.  His creatinine remained in the 1.6 to 1.9 range on the floor and stable.  His baseline creatinine is around 1.  He was not started on diuretics at discharge.  A peripherally inserted central catheter line was placed for administration of intravenous vancomycin for his high-grade methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermitis bacteremia. The patient was seen by Physical Therapy and was discharged from their service as he had no acute physical therapy needs. The patient did have a candidal infection of his groin area which was treated with topical anti-fungal medications, to which he responded well to.  Toward the end of his hospital stay, the patient did have increased diarrhea.  His lactulose was held which improved his diarrhea somewhat; however, he did complain of increased diarrhea.  He did have Clostridium difficile toxins times three days which were sent.  These were negative for Clostridium difficile.  The patient was discharged on no diuretics; however, the possibility of restarting Aldactone 50 mg will be considered as an outpatient.  He will be discharged with a total course of four to six weeks of vancomycin.  The start date on his vancomycin was [**2138-3-30**].  CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Fair.  DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1.  Hepatitis C cirrhosis; awaiting liver transplantation. 2.  Acute renal failure. 3.  Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia; on vancomycin.  MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1.  Miconazole nitrate powder applied three times per day as needed to groin rash. 2.  Protonix 40 mg q.12h. 3.  Lactulose 30 mL by mouth three times per day (titrated to four to five bowel movements per day). 4.  Vancomycin 1 gram intravenously q.12h. (for a total of six weeks); his vancomycin dose will be changed per trough levels and his renal function.  DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to follow up in the Liver Clinic in two days from discharge.

CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2157-11-6**] 2:24 PM CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST CHEST: There is no morphologically significant mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. There is no pericardial or pleural effusion. In the lung window, note is made of atelectatic opacities in the lung bases, however, no other consolidation is noted. The central airways are patent. The evaluation of the lung parenchyma is somewhat limited due to a motion artifact. ABDOMEN: Again note is made of 1.7 cm low-density lesion in the right lobe of the liver, unchanged since prior study, most likely representing liver cyst. Note is made of small amount of gallbladder edema with normal enhancement of the mucosa, with a nondistended gallbladder. Spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and the visualized portion of the large and small intestines are within normal limits. No significant lymphadenopathy. No ascites. Again note is made of a low-density lesion in the right kidney, unchanged since prior study. PELVIS: The visualized portion of large and small intestines are within normal limits. There is no ascites or lymphadenopathy. There is no suspicious lytic or blastic lesion in skeletal structures. IMPRESSION: 1. NO evidence of pneumonica or abdominal abscess. 2. Mild edema surrounding nondistended gallbladder. Clinical correlation is recommended. 3. Liver cyst and renal cyst. 4. Basilar atelectasis. . CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST  [**2157-11-9**] 3:45 PM There are patent nasal-antral ostia, bilaterally. Uncinate processes are intact, however, and there are no signs of post-surgical change. The appearance is smooth and symmetric, suggesting that the appearance may be congenital, or perhaps, related to remote inflammation. There is minimal mucosal thickening in the ethmoid sinuses, with slight circumferential mucosal thickening in the sphenoid sinus. The maxillary and frontal sinuses are clear. There are no air-fluid levels to suggest acute sinusitis. There is a large bony spur associated with mild leftward deviation of the nasal septum, but the middle meatus is widely patent. The orbits and surrounding soft tissue structures are unremarkable. The osseous structures are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: 1. Minimal sphenoid and ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening, without air-fluid levels to suggest acute sinusitis. 2. Patent maxillary sinus secondary ostia, most likely congenital. . CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2157-11-18**] 3:59 PM New right middle lobe consolidation. Given the fast appearance during the last 10 days it most likely represents bacterial pneumonia. Other sources of infection in a neutropenic patient such as fungal infection, for example aspergillosis or mucormycosis cannot be excluded. These findings were communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10351**] during dictation of this exam. .

Brief Hospital Course: 61 y/o F admitted for Autologous Bone marrow transplant with CBV regimen for treatment of large B-cell lymphoma. She is status post multiple chemotherapy regimens and a BM harvest in the OR after failed peripheral blood stem cell collection . Lymphoma: The patient was admitted to undergo autologous stem cell transplantation with high dose chemotherapy with CBV therapy. Admitted Day-7 and began chemotherapy D-7. Etoposide, Cytoxan, MESNA, BCNU given with last dose 9/30. Day -2 started acyclovir, ursodiol.  PBCS given during course of chemo. [**10-17**]- Day -1 patient complained of severe nausea with emesis. [**10-18**], on day 0 stem cells given with gross hematuria during. Hematuria prior considered hemorrhagic cystitis related to cytoxan. Patient vigorously hydrated. Course complicated by severe nausea, emesis, severe mucositis, and prolonged neutropenia. Mucositis severe with difficulty swallowing secretions, hematocrit and platelets monitored and patient made NPO with TPN and fentanyl PCA for pain. Mucositis greatly improved by [**10-31**], but unfortunately patient did not engraft as of day +17, ANC 150, with very slow progression of WBC, though given bone marrow would expect slower recovery. . Fever: Pt developed a fever to 100.9 on [**10-12**]. Cultures sent, Chest x-ray with likely pneumonia. Penicillin allergy, pt unsure if cephalasporin as well. Treated with levofloxacin and vancomycin. Continued with chemo. Concerning given for autologous SCT 3 days of chemo with new pneumonia, though patient asymptomatic and not dramatic picture on CXR. With persistence of low grade temps cefepime also started [**10-15**]. Patient completed seven day course for CAP on [**10-15**]. line site with erythema, pt still febrile, added flagyl to already broad coverage of cefepime, vanc, caspo. cefepime started [**10-19**], DC [**10-25**]. flagyl started [**10-24**], DC [**10-25**]. meropenem started [**10-25**], given nausea. caspo started [**10-21**].

Of note patient neutropenic with ANC 150 day +17. . Dysphagia- onset [**10-18**] in relation to severe mucositis, etiologies to consider primarily musositis, though viral bacterial, fungal infection, [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear from severe wretching all possibilities. Patient kept NPO, TPN started, acyclovir, cefepime, and fentanyl PCA. Improved by day +15, and patient able to tolerate PO, though with emesis. . Anemia, thrombocytopenia- epistaxis. Platelets and PRBC transfusions throughout course of stay. . nausea- zofran, ativan, and anzemet with chemo. scopolamine patch attempted in addition to decadron 4 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Patient continued to have severe nausea which dissipated one into treatment but returned three weeks into treatment once patient attempted to restart PO intake. Emesis shortly after eating with no associated cramping. Patient with bowel movements and passing flatus. KUB negative for obtruction and patient encouraged to start slow with PO to advance as tolerated. . ICU COURSE: Patient transferred to ICU on [**2157-11-27**] after found to have a worsening RML consolidation, occluded RML bronchus, and bilateral effusions. Pt underwent bronchoscopy, had new O2 requirement (94% on 6L) after the procedure. She was subsequently placed on BiPAP, progressively worsening SOB and O2 requirement, and became more SOB requiring 60% FM with 6L NC to maintain O2 sat in the 90's. Pt transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring. She had repeat bronchoscopy. Large mucous plug noted in RML bronchus, unable to be removed. . Ultimately, her SOB/hypoxia felt possibly an infectious etiology although no identified source after 3 BALs. Pt with significant lung pathology (RML consolidation, RML bronchus occlusion, and BL pleural effusions) as well as RLL involvment. She had three total bronchs without bug isolated. Abx regimen: levoflox, flagyl, caspo, Posaconazle later switched to ambisome, and Minocylcine. Minocycline for coverage of some Nocardia species (other options cause marrow suppression including Bactrim, Linezolid). Meropenem was attempted; however, after desensitization, patient developed A-fib after dose. It was unclear and unlikely that the afib was related to the meropenam.  . During her ICU course, she also developed Afib with RVR. Started on Procainamide, per cards recs. She continued metoprolol 25mg PO BID, discontinued digoxin. Her hemondynamic status was unstable and metoprolol was then stopped. Then, she was noted to have several episodes of V tach, which resolved prior to requiring pads. Her QTc was monitored while on Procainamide. . On [**2157-11-30**], her cardiac status had not improved. She also became hypotensive and bradycardic, ultimately requiring dobutamine and levophed with minimal improvement in MAP. UOP declined, lactate rose to 14. . Family meeting with patients family and oncologists on [**2157-11-30**]. Family ultimately decided that patient should have no further escalation of care. Later that evening, patient's BP and HR began to decline, and she passed away peacefully with family by bedside. Family agreed to an autopsy to shed light on the cause for her hypoxia/pulmonary dysfunction as well as for the subacute worsening of hemodynamic status, decreased UOP, and elevated lactate.  Medications on Admission: 1. Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4-6H (every 4  to 6 hours) as needed. 2.

At admission, patient was found to be a poor historian and much of the history was apparently taken from medical records per OSH and the pt's sister.  Per sister, pt first presented to PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**11-29**] with ~8-9 days of nearly daily headache, nausea and vomiting. She was unable to provide details of headache. PCP arranged for head CT which was normal, and pt sent home. Sister accompanied him home, and realized that pt having difficulty with tasks such as dialing phone or using spoon. Normally pt lives alone, and sister felt he was unsafe so brought him to [**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital, where he was admitted from [**Date range (1) 65003**]. While there, he had MRI that per OSH discharge summary showed small bilateral strokes in postrior parietal parasaggital region near the parieto-occipital fissure, thought to be watershed however this was not observed. Also in differential was possible viral meningoencephalitis. Stroke workup with negative carotid US, echo, normal lipids and A1C, no arrythmias. He was started on ASA. On discharge he had full strength, was still having difficulty making phone calls. Headache had improved, though not fully resolved. Sister reports that he was getting percocet in hospital, though he was not discharged with any.  Since discharge, sister reports that pt complaining of slowly worsening headache. Also has been complaining of trouble seeing, ""I can't see the kitchen sink."" He saw his PCP yesterday who thought headaches might be migraines, and gave him Zomig. Today the headache worsened and pt returned to OSH ED. Head CT showed left parieto-occipital bleed and pt transferred for further management.  Per sister and brother-in-law, pt ""does OK on all your tests, but he still has trouble functioning, such as trouble getting dressed."" At baseline (prior to recent headaches) pt did have some cognitive difficulties, and some trouble articulating. He is worse now, but it is not entirely clear the time course of this. The trouble making phone calls is definitely new. Also of note, he has had some recent med changes after psych hospitalization at [**Hospital1 **] ~3 months ago. Also, while at OSH pt refused risperdal and was started on seroquel instead.  Currently, pt reports vertex headache, am unable to get any more details. Also reports +nausea, trouble talking and trouble seeing. No chest pain, abdominal pain. Notes some left leg weakness as well.   Social History: Lives alone, is own guardian. Sister had been his guardian in the past but apparently a court has determined that she is no longer allowed to hold this position.    Family History: Sister with mental illness.

Reflexes: DTRs decreased and symmetric throughout, except absent  at knees. Toes were mute bilaterally  Coordination is normal on finger-nose-finger Gait deferred.   Pertinent Results: MRI/MRA [**12-24**]: 1. MR features of a 43 x 34 mm intracerebral hematoma at the left parietal/occipital region, with surrounding vasogenic edema, and extension of hemorrhage into the adjacent subarachnoid spaces and ventricular system. 2. No obstructive hydrocephalus is seen at present. 3. No pathological enhancement to identify an underlying lesion relating to the left parietal-occipital hematoma. 4. Normal brain MR angiography. . TTE: No valvular vegetations or intracardiac thrombi seen. EF>55%. No PFO/ASD. . CT head [**1-8**]: There has been evolution of the previously noted blood products in the left parieto-occipital region, overall unchanged in extent in the interval. However, new in the interval is hypodensity in the left internal capsule and thalamus, which is exerting slight mass effect on the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle. This is concerning for acute or subacute infarction. No new intracranial hemorrhage or other new suspicious areas of hypodensity are noted. There is no hydrocephalus. The basilar cisterns are visible. The mastoid air cells are opacified bilaterally. The remainder of the paranasal sinuses and the orbits are unremarkable. . EEG [**1-8**]: IMPRESSION: This is a mildly abnormal EEG due to the presence of a focal area of slowing in the left anterior quadrant suggestive of a subcortical abnormality in this region. Background frequencies were also somewhat slower than normal, suggesting the presence of a mild encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology. . CTA neck [**1-10**]: 1. Left internal jugular vein thrombosis as described. Question of left sigmoid sinus partial thrombosis, versus mixing artifact. 2. Mastoid and partial ethmoid and sphenoid sinus opacification. . CT head [**1-12**]: 1. New hemorrhagic transformation of left caudate nucleus infarction. Blood products within the fourth ventricle. Close clinical followup and followup CT scan recommended. 2. Probable superior sagittal sinus thrombosis and possible thrombosis of the left sigmoid sinus, with continued thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein. . CT head [**1-29**] (compared to [**1-19**]):  There has been no significant change from [**2156-1-20**] with a stable appearing left frontal hemorrhage with surrounding edema. There is also a resolving region of hypodensity from hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe. There is stable appearance of the effaced frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle. No new foci of hemorrhage are indicated. There is no shift of normally midline structures. There is some left sphenoid sinus mucosal thickening. IMPRESSION: Multiple stable hemorrhages as described above with no new significant change from [**2156-1-20**]. .

Upon admission he was found to have a large left parietal hemorrhage. The exam upon admission was notable for inattention, anomia, right field cut, mild-moderate R hemiparesis, and perseveration. . Neuro: The patient was transferred to the Neuro/ICU  for telemetry and aggressive blood pressure control. Neurosurgery evaluated him and no surgical intervention was necessary. His MRI/MRA scans revealed a large (~40cc) hemorrhage near the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white junction in the left parietal lobe. There was no clear underlying mass and there were no underlying vascular abnormalities per MRA (no aneurysms/AVM). An ECHO, to look for a cardio-embolic etiology, was negative (no valvular vegetations or intracardiac thrombi; no PFO/ASD, but not with certainty as the image quality was poor). Mr [**Known lastname 65004**] then developed a L thalamic infarct [**1-8**], and was less alert, with increased R hemiparesis. An EEG ([**1-8**]) showed focal slowing in the L anterior quadrant. A hemorrhagic conversion of the infract was then noted on [**1-12**] with some intraventricular blood (found incidentally when getting CTV). The CTV ([**1-12**]) showed a L superior sagittal sinus thrombosis and ?L sigmoid sinus thrombosis  with extension into the internal jugular vein. A repeat head CT [**1-14**], showed no evidence of hydrocephalus, and no further blood in 4th ventricle. Mr. [**Known lastname 65004**] was started on anticoagulation with Lovenox on [**1-13**].  He was also given a short course of Diamox for L hemisphere edema. Neurosurg was re-consulted to monitor the hemorrhage into the 4th ventricle given the risk of hydrocephalus. No intervention was necessary. Follow up CT-head series showed a stable picture. . Psychiatry: The patient was maintained on seroquel. Depakote was discontinued, and lithium was started [**1-6**]. Lithium levels should be monitored closely (every 2 weeks) and the dosing should be adjusted accordingly. The patient has been closely followed by the psychiatry service. Please contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65005**], [**Numeric Identifier 65006**] if any questions arise. Close follow up will be arranged. Haldol was given on a PRN basis. . Cardiovascular: An Echo showed an EF>55%. The patient was ruled out for an MI [**1-8**]. Goal SBP<160. Lipids profile was within normal limits. EKG should be checked if the patient receives haldol on a regular basis (risk for prolonged QT). . FEN/GI: -cardiac prudent diet . Hematology: The patient was noted to be thrombocytopenic w/nadir in 80s, likely secondary to Depakote. Plt normalized after Depakote was discontinued. As part of a workup related to the sinus thrombosis the following tests were done: -No LE DVT on [**1-11**] U/S. -Hypercoagulable workup: Fibrinogen 482, D-dimer 2938. Homocysteine wnl, [**Doctor First Name **] neg, Lupus anticoagulant neg, ATIII wnl, FVL neg. Prot C slightly low 63, Prot S elevated (?acute phase reactant). Factor VIII and anticardiolipin normal. Prothrombin gene mutation pending. Please resend hypercoag workup again in the future if Pt ever comes off anticoagulation. The patient was started on anticoagulation with lovenox as he is not a coumadin candidate. Lovenox level 2.0 on [**1-26**], after which the dose was decreased; level on [**2-1**]: 1.06; level on [**2-3**]: 0.9 (i.e. within goal range). . Other: The patient has had multiple falls [**12-31**], [**1-5**], [**1-6**] x2, all secondary to orthostasis, a R field cut, and impulsivity. Please check orthostatics in case the patient is unsteady. . Endocrine: -TSH 3.4; Levoxyl was continued. Please continue to monitor. -HbA1C 5.2, no intervention needed. . ID: On Cipro [**Date range (1) 14813**] for E. coli UTI. UA on [**2-2**] was negative. . ENT: Sinus opacification upon admission. This has resolved. If patient becomes symptomatic he will need ENT follow up. . Legal: Mr [**Known lastname 65004**] has a legal guardian since [**1-30**]. [**Name2 (NI) **] is incompetent to sign consent for procedures as he cannot clearly understand its risks and benefits. His sister who had been his previous guardian was legally not permitted to hold this position any longer.

EKG: reviewed - sinus tach - no acute ST/TW changes, old LAD, poor r-wave progression, possible LAE <br>  Brief Hospital Course: 86 yo Iranian (farsi speaking) male with h/o COPD (on home o2 (uses 2-3h qdaily of home o2 overall), HTN, restless leg syndrome, BPH transferred for hypercarbic respiratory failure.  # Acute on Chronic Hypercarbic repiratory failure: # Acute COPD exacerbation He presented to the ED with shortness of breath and change in mental status.  He was admitted to the floor for ARF and COPD exacerbation.  He then develooped AMS and and decreased respiratory rate with a gas of 7.16/105/69.  This was thought to be secondary to methadone overdose due to taking 30mg [**Hospital1 **] rather than 15mg [**Hospital1 **] when he received 10mg tabs rather than 5mg tabs from his pharmacy.  He required BiPAP the first day in the ICU given that his PCO2 was 105 on the floor.  He was started on a narcan gtt with improvement of his respiratory status.  His narcan gtt was discontinued on [**4-8**] in the AM as he was alert and speaking farsi.  He was given fentanyl boluses and ativan while in the ICU to help with withdrawal and to tx his restless leg syndrome.  He was started on Solumedrol 125mg IV q6hrs which was continued x2 days, then transitioned to prednisone. He was also started on azithromycin.  [**4-9**] his home dose of methadone was restarted 15mg PO BID.  Pt is on 2L oxygen at home but taken off oxygen this AM with goal O2 sat 88-92% as likely is chronic CO2 retainer. Patient??????s mental status is at baseline now oriented to self and yr by his calendar, confirmed with family that his mental status is good.  He was given Rx for albuterol MDI and is to continue his home inhalers as well.  # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure ?????? appeared pre renal in etiology, now resolved. He is to continue his home Tamsulosin and Finasteride, lasix.  # Restless Leg syndrome ?????? See above patient may have accidentally overdosed on his methadone.  His mental status responded to a narcan gtt.  He was given prn fentanyl until [**4-9**] at which point he was restarted on his home methadone 15mg PO BID.  Emphasized appropriate dosing to pt, family, and have set up VNA services to ensure he understands his medication.  # Anemia, microcytic - has h/o thalessemia. HCT stable during admission.  # Code status: he did not require intubation and family reports he does not have any history of COPD hospitalizations.  Code status is full, but his providers did discuss with family the possibility of a comfort-focused, noninvasive approach when he was very ill in the unit.  Recommend that further goals of care discussion continue with his PCP.

There is mild right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.  Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-12-4**], the pericardial effusion is similar in size; however, left atrial chamber invagination is now present. In addition, the right ventricvle appears somewhat more compressed . [**2182-12-4**] Cath: . Pericadial effusion without clinical signs of tamponade and with normal RA pressure. 2.  Unsuccesful pericardiocentesis. Multiple attempts to access the pericardial space using a subxiphoid approach were unsuccesful. TTE obtained during the procedure showed anterior collection but not at apex and beneath liver edge. Despite echo guidance, the operator was still unable to enter the pericardial space. The patient developed left shoulder pain during the procedure attempts that resolved with removal of the needle.  FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. No clinical signs of tamponade, normal RA pressure. 2. Unsuccesful pericardiocentesis   Brief Hospital Course: # Pericardial effusion: On admission the patient was taken to cath lab for pericardiocentesis. During the procedure pericardial fluid was failed to be obtained. Hemodynamics inconsistent with tamponade physiology. The patient was admitted to the CCU for continued monitoring. Repeat TTE [**12-7**] demonstrated new LA and RV invagination. CT surgery was consulted and the patient was taken for pericardial window. She tolerated the procedure well with no complications. Drain and chest tube placed during procedure. Removed on [**12-10**] after repeat TTE on [**12-10**] demonstrated a normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and normal systolic function and a resolution of pericardial fluid. Her pericardial fluid was of unclear etiology. Rheumatology was consulted and her sulfasalazine was discontinued for concern of drug induced lupus given effusion and decreasing WBC. WBC did stabalize after stopping medication. Also concern for collagen vascular disease. Panel of autoimmune antibodies pending at time of discharge. Cytology and pericardial biopsy also pending at time of discharge. [**Doctor First Name **] to evaluate for TB as cause pending. The patient did report recent URI symptoms, can consider pericarditis as cause of effusion. EBV, CMV pending. HIV negative. She also reports a family history of breast CA - recent mamogram WNL. The patient was discharged home in good condition to follow up with her PCP and rheumatology for further management. . # Hypotension - Pt BP range 80s-110 systolic. The patient does have low BP at baseline. Reported recent poor po intake and history of eating disorder. She received intermittent fluid bolus, likely due to increased insensible losses. She also has a history of increased urine output with lithium induced CRI. . # Psych: continued on home medications Abilify, Quetiapine . # Question of Psoriatic arthiritis: continued prednisone per Rheumatology recommendation. Sulfasalazine DC'd due to concern for drug induced lupus . # Vaginal Bleeding - During her hospitalization the patient reported scant vaginal bleeding. She has been post-menopausal for many years. She was advised to undergo further workup for this bleeding as outpatient. Given her past history of sexual abuse she has reported refusing previous pelvic examination. . # Fibromyalgia: continued tizanidine and Ultram  # CKD: creatinine at baseline. . The patient is scheduled to follow up with Cardiology, CT surgery, Rheumatology and her PCP for further management. Also to follow up on outstanding pericardial fluid cytology and biopsy, as well as pending Autoimmune workup.

He drinks 1 quart of vodka several days a week and last drink was around [**6-12**] or [**6-13**]. He ruled out with 2 sets of negative cardiac enzymes and a non-ischemic ekg, and was evaluated by cardiology. CXR neg for acute process. His chest pain was felt likely due to bronchitis. During the hospitalization he continued to exhibit withdrawal symptoms so was started on CIWA. He required 20mg IV lorazepam during the initial 6 hours of withdrawal and had respiratory distress, cyanosis, and stridor. During intubation he was noted to have a vocal cord polypoid mass and is thus being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. Over the past 24 hours he has required 12mg IV lorazepam. He is also on levofloxacin for unclear reason. VS prior to transfer were 100.7, 87, 120/72, 31, 95%.

Hospital course complicated by etoh withdrawal. Patient reportedly developed stridor. ENT evaluated patient with CT scan and felt he may have had a mass around the cords. He was sent to [**Hospital1 **] for further evaluation.  ACTIVE ISSUES: # Respiratory failure/Hypoxemia/Laryngeal Edema: Patient was intubated at OSH for respiratory distress. On tubated there was a polypoid lesion on his vocal cords and he was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation. Here, ENT performed direct laryngoscopy which revealed edematous cords. He was given a short course of steroids. Extubation was attempted however resulted in recurrent respiratory distress requiring reintubation. ENT felt that he has [**Last Name (un) 50614**] edema which will resolve in a few weeks. He underwent tracheostomy placement. ***PATIENT WILL REQUIRE DOWN-SIZING OF TRACH DURING WEEK OF [**7-8**] PER IP RECOMMENDATIONS.*** He was also need follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in ENT.  # Ventilator Associated Pneumonia: Patient was treated with 7 days of antibiotics while in patient. He remained afebrile.  # Pulmonary Embolism: While intubated, patient was difficult to ventilate. A CT was performed which revealed multiple PEs. He was started on lovenox. After all procedures are completed, he should transition to Coumadin for at least a 6 month course unless the mass is found to be a solid tumor, in which case there is some evidence to use LMWH for solid tumors over coumadin.  # Alcohol Dependence, withdrawal: Given thiamine, folic acid, multivitamin. Ciwa scale was maintained while in the ICU  # Clostridium difficile Colitis: dx made on [**2120-6-28**]. Was started for 10 day course of PO Flagyl and will be completed on [**2120-7-8**].  # Anxiety: Patient started on clonazepam for anxiety. Will likely need to wean this prior to discharge from facility.  Transitions of care: - will need outpatient speech and swallow appointment to discuss advancing his diet once ENT has cleared him. - will need trach changed out during week of [**7-8**]  Medications on Admission: Home Medications: Girlfriend unable to recall Transfer Medications: 1. pantoprazole 40mg daily 2. acetaminophen 650mg Q6h prn 3. heparin 5000units SC Q8h 4. artificial tears 5. chlorhexidine 15ml TID 6. propofol 100ml IV Q4h 7. vecuronium 8mg Q6h IV prn 8. lorazepam Q2h IV prn CIWA 9. levofloxacin 100ml IV Q24h 10. guaifenesin 200mg Q4h prn 11. nitroglycerin 0.4mg SL prn   Discharge Medications: 1.

You were admitted to the hospital for alcoholic detoxification and respiratory distress due to airway compromise from swollen vocal cords. It is not exactly clear why there was swelling around your vocal cords but a tracheostomy was needed to protect your airway and you will need to see the ENT doctor when you leave the hospital to assess further plans to manage these issues. After you see the ENT doctor, you should following up with a speech/swallow therapist to discuss advancing your diet.  While in the hospital, you developed a clot in your lungs which you will need to been on blood thinning medications for. You also have an infection of your colon for which you will need to take a course of antibiotics. Please be sure to complete this course of antibiotics.

Brief Hospital Course: 52 year old female with a history of lone atrial fibrillation and Lyme meningitis presenting with progressive shortness of breath and DOE over past 2 weeks admitted to the MICU with pleural effusions and a pericardial effusion in the setting of presumed viral pleurisy and pericarditis that developed into an effusion after chronic NSAID use possible aspiration/CAP PNA who developed AFIB with RVR secondary to pain and pericardial effusion, transaminitis with cholestasis and acute renal failure in the setting of anemia and NSAID use who has a persistent O2 requirement with pleuritic pain and resolving pericardial effusion.  She improved clinically prior to discharge after CT placement for her L effusion and a thoracentesis to remove her R sided pleural effusion. . # SOB/CP/hypoxia: Likely multifactorial with most obvious etiologies being pleural, pericardial effusions, and . PE was less likely given [**5-23**] CTA negative. Due to her effusions, it was thought she may have an underlying PNA and she was started on levaquin for CAP.  She was given a prolonged course due to concern that she may have had infection in her pericardial fluid.  The day after admission ([**6-7**]) she was intubated for hemodynamic control(Afib RVR 150s), pain control, and for potential procedure for a possible pericardial window.  From a respiratory prospective she was comfortable prior to intubation which was done under rapid sequence given signs of early tamponade.  She was extubated without event when it was determined that cardiology did not think her pericardal effusion needed to be drained.  Instead, cardiology recommended serial Echo's to follow the effusions size.  An echo on [**6-14**] showed that the effusion was reduced in size compared to prior imaging. . #Afib with RVR: The Patient has a history of lone atrial fibrillation. On day of admission patient went to Afib to 200s briefly sustaining in the 160s.  This was thought [**2-23**] to pain and infection vs tamponade physiology.  She received metroprolol IV and dilt drip. When patient was intubated, she converted back to sinus rhythm and maintained in sinus rhythm.  After extubation and while on the floor the patient did not have any palpitations or further episodes of Afib wtih RVR. - She will need to discuss with her outpatient physician [**Name9 (PRE) **] with aspirin when her pericardial effusion resolves. . # Pleural Effusions: She presented with pleuritic chest pain which was initially attributed to her pleural effusions. Initially, the DDx was broad including infectious(Lyme/parvo negative, [**Location (un) **] pending), malignant(cytology ultimately negative), and rheumatologic([**Doctor First Name **] negative and C3/C4 normal). CHF and cirrhosis unlikely based on H+P. Lipase normal makes pancreatits unlikely. Thoracentesis reveals exudate, likely parapneumonic given fevers, and a viral pleuritis was also considered.  ID was consulted who recommended empiric coverage for CAP with a prolonged course of Levofloxacin (14 days - finish on [**6-20**]) due to a concern that the pericardial fluid could [**Hospital1 **] infection.  Cytology negative, cultures negative. Morphine and fentanyl pleuritic CP. The most likely diagnosis was a viral infection with a superimposed bacterial process possibly in the setting of aspiration 1 week prior.  Of note her effusions persisted despite antibiotic therapy and NSAID therapy.  She was given diuretics with lasix which did not reduced the size of her effusion.  Therefore, a L sided chest tube placement by IP in addition to a right sided thoracentesis. After subsequent removal of her bilateral pleural effusions, her symptoms of SOB and O2 requirement resolved. . # Pericardial Effusion: Initially echo concerning for early but not overt tamponade physiology and exam was concerning. Patient was given IVF to maintain preload. Serologies were sent as above. Her pulsus was monitored closely and was never above 12mmHG. Cardiology consult followed closely and serial echos showed improvement in effusions. The decision was made not to drain effusions for diagnostic purposes given the risks involved.  She was restarted on NSAID therapy for viral pericarditis.  Of note, her effusion improved by echo prior to discharge. . # CAP:  Given her exudative effusion and viral pleuritis there was concern for CAP and possible aspiration.  She was given a two week course of levofloxacin to finish on the date listed above. . # Diarrhea:  She had transient episode of diarrhea while on antibiotics, and her diarrhea resolved. . # [**Last Name (un) **]/Low UO: Dark urine and poor output early in ICU course. Thought potentially from NSAIDs. Renal spun urine and it was not active.  She had low UOP, which improved with IVF. . Cholestasis and Hepatitis:  She was noted to have to have abnormal LFT's with cholestatsis in addition to pleuritic R sided abdominal pain.  There was concern that she could have either a viral induced hepatitis with cholestasis versus a congestive hepatopathy in the setting of mild volume overload. Cholecystitis was less likely given the absence of a white count.  Her LFT's trended down independent of diuresis thereby suggesting/confirming a possible viral etiology for her hepatitis and cholestasis.  Of note her hepatitis serologies were negative. . # Anemia: Baseline hct 40s most recently in [**2171**]. No signs or symptoms of bleeding. Likely from systemic process going on. Normal colonoscopy in [**2171**]. Of note, she is currently menopausal, and has iron studies that suggest she has anemia of chronic disease, or at least anemia with acute inflammation. - She will need a CBC as an outpatient.

CXR [**2178-3-27**]: (prelim) Bilateral moderate sized pleural effusions. No pneumothorax. Pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly. Bibasal atelectasis. Findings similar to earlier CT chest.  Brief Hospital Course: 83-year-old man with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, ongoing chemoradiation, presents with altered mental status.  1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient had been in sinus tachycardia to ~120 since admission despite 2L IVF and 2 units pRBC. Given this and his 2L O2 requirement, he went for CTA chest, which showed no PE, but large bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis. He was agitated since the CTA, and around 6pm, he looked cyanotic and had a desaturation to 60% on 2L, improved to 93% on NRB. He was given 20mg lasix IV with brisk urine output, as well as 0.5mg IV haloperidol and 10mg IV hydralazine (BP ~180/90) and transferred to the ICU. Stat CXR showed diffuse pulmonary edema, and with his concurrent hypertension, he was started on a nitroglycerin drip. His BP improved and overshot transiently down to 70/30, but rapidly improved to ~130s/80s with cessation of drip. His O2 sats remained in the 90s on high-flow oxygen mask. He was sent for CT head given his altered mental status and possibly new anisocoria. While being transported, he developed bradycardia down to 20, desaturation, and apnea requiring bag ventilation. On evaluation, there were no palpable pulses and no obtainable blood pressure. Given his confirmed DNR status, he was not resuscitated and expired. Post-mortem exam was declined.  2. Altered mental status: Cause not entirely clear, but possible contribution from opioids at home, as well as hyponatremia. He was also treated with levofloxacin for a possible pneumonia, given left basilar opacity, mild hypoxia (93% RA), low grade temps (99.7) and cough. When the patient became agitated as noted in the events described above, he was treated with 0.5mg IV haloperidol prn (total 1.5mg given) with good effect. CT head with no acute process on admission and was planned to be repeated given anisocoria, but aborted given above events.  3. Hyponatremia: Treated with IV fluids with improvement from 117 to 127.  4. Tongue cancer: On cisplatin and radiation, with radiation received during this admission.  5. Anemia: Hct 22 on admission. Transfused 2 units PRBCs with improvement to 30.7.

PE, multiinfarct dementia and recurrent UTI who presents with lethargy, hypoxia, and LE erythema. Pt is aphasic at baseline. Per notes from ED and PCP coverage, the patient was being treated for recurrent UTI with a course of levofloxacin started on [**6-7**] but was otherwise doing well. Last night she was noted to be more lethargic than normal with increasing SOB. She was noted to be hypoxic with O2 Sats of 80% so was transferred to the ED.  In the ED she had a fever to 101.8 with intermittent hypoxia that improved to 98% with 4LNS oxygen . She was given Clindamycin 600mg IV x1 for LE cellulitis and a dose of Levofloxacin 500mg IV for possible UTI. For her hypoxia, she was given 20mg IV Lasix and a combivent neb with significant improvement with CTA neg for PE and LENI neg for DVT. She continued to have intermittent hypoxia of unclear etiology so was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring. . In the MICU, the patient was treated with CTX and Vanc for UTI/cellulitis. Also diuresed. Patient improved and sent to floor [**6-11**] on 2L NC. Patient noted to have increased Eos in blood and urine so CTX stopped and placed on levo/macrodantin. . [**6-13**] Patient decompenstated on the floor. Patient desatted to 80's on 6L NC.

Patient given 5mg IV lopressor x 3 with out response in HR. Transferred back unit for further mgt of HR and hypoxia, where she was started on a diltiazem drip; CTA was without evidence of PE. Course complicated by persistent hypotension requiring multiple fluid boluses; this resolved after the discontinuation of the diltiazem drip. She was started on an amiodarone load with conversion into NSR. Her O2 sat improved with diuresis. A picc line was placed and she was started on aztreonam (instead of macrobid) for UTI. She was transferred back to the general medical floor on [**2175-6-16**]. Currently, she has a new rash over her trunk and arms bilaterally--thought to be from Ceftriaxone.

His ability to relate a consistent hx is currently impaired, but per prior notes, it seems that he was told by his neighbor to come to the hospital as he appeared short of breath.  The initial assessment of ED staff was that the pt was massively fluid overloaded in the setting of CHF and non-compliance with lasix. He was treated with Lasix IV 40mg x 2, ASA 325 and nitro, although no chest pain and EKG . Further review of OMR reveals that the pt is no on lasix and has no clinical hx of CHF, last echo in [**2119**] showed preserved LVEF of 55 with only mild Ao dilation. . Initial labs were notable for Na of 116 with K of 6.6 (initial 7.8 was hemolyzed) and CR 2.7; no EKG changes. LFTs elevated AST 120, ALT 50, with bili 4.5, INR 1.6, albumin 2.6. With one dose of kayexalate, potassium has trended down to 5.3. Serial troponins 0.04. Initial CK 700 trending down with minimal MB fraction. . In terms of his mental status, his PCP saw him one month ago at which point he was at baseline A&OX3, independent for all ADLs. MS not in ED not clearly documented. At 8AM this morning, he trigerred for tachypnea with RR close to 30 and worsened MS A&Ox1 only to self. [**Hospital **] transferred to the MICU. On arrival, pt was on 2L and confused/somnolent.

Pathology: Liver Biopsy [**2124-12-21**]: Liver, transjugular needle core biopsy: Markedly fragmented biopsy demonstrating: 1.  Predominantly fragments of broad, fibrous septa with mild, mixed inflammation and focal cholangiolar proliferation, consistent with established cirrhosis (confirmed by trichrome stain). 2.  Scant, nodular foci of hepatic lobular parenchyma (totaling only 20% of the total biopsy volume), with focal microvesicular steatosis and moderate canalicular cholestasis. 3.  No central veins or native portal tracts present for evaluation in this limited sample. 4.  Iron stain shows moderate iron deposition within hepatocytes. Note:  The biopsy consists almost exclusively of fibrous tissue, consistent with established cirrhosis.  The scant lobular parenchyma present shows only minimal, non-specific changes of end stage liver disease. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4370**] [**Name (STitle) **] was notified of the findings on [**2124-12-22**].   Brief Hospital Course: This is a 61 yom with hx of HTN and COPD who initially presented to the ED c/o SOB and noted to be massively fluid overloaded, in ARF with hyponatremia/hyperkalemia, with transaminitis and synthetic dysfunction who was then admitted to the MICU for altered mental status and eventually intubated for respiratory distress and fluid overload.  # Acute on Chronic Liver Failure:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented with total body fluid overload.  He had a transaminitis which improved and worsened several times throughout his hospital stay.  He had synthetic dysfunction of the liver manifested by thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy.  All of these findings were consistent with cirrhosis.  A CT scan on admission confirmed a nodular liver.  He slowly developed worsening liver failure during his hospitalization.  A liver biopsy was done on [**2124-12-21**] which confirmed cirrhosis.  Hepatitis serologies were sent and were negative for Hep B and Hep C.  Hep A antibody was positive. Hepatology was consulted and cirrhosis was thought to be [**3-6**] history of EtOH abuse.  Tranaminitis in the hospital was unclear but possibly [**3-6**] shock liver in the setting of hypotension.  INR continued to rise and peaked to a level of 27 today.  Family was involved and a family meeting was held today given his worsensing liver failure and shock which was requiring 4 pressors.  He was made CMO by his father, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], and the patient passed away peacefully today at 225pm.  # Hypoxic respiratory failure/Pneumonia:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was initially intubated for respiraroty distress in the setting of hypoxemia [**3-6**] fluid overload.  He was treated with diuretics with minimal urine output.  Renal was consulted and he was diagnosed with Hepatorenal syndrome and required dialysis for fluid removal.  He was placed on HD with good removal of fluid intitially. WBC then began to elevate and CXR was consistent with Pneumonia so he was started on Vanco/Zosyn/Levo for treament of hospital acquired pneumonia.  He completed a 7 day course for his PNA.  He self extubated while in the MICU and was then reintubated for respiratory distress.  He then developed VAP while intubated and was treated with Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro.  # Shock:  Patient had acute decompensated liver failure along with pneumonia which were likely contributing to his shock. Broead infectious workup was done and workup remained negative while in the hospital.  He was treated with Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for treatment of HAP.  Flagyl was started out of concern for c.diff although c.diff cultures remained negative.  # Altered mental status: Thought to be secondary to hepatic encephalopathy.  Initially improved with lactulose.  Patient was treated with lactulose and rifaximin throughout his stay.  # Acute Renal Failure:  Thought to be [**3-6**] hepatorenal syndrome. He developed anuria while in the hospital.  Given his fluid overload and pulmonary edema requiring intubation, renal was consulted and a dialysis line was placed.  He was placed on HD for removal of fluid.  This was changed to CVVH when he became hypotensive to allow for gentle fluid removal.  # Hyponatremia: Thought to be [**3-6**] fluid overload in the setting of cirrhosis  # Coagulopathy: Likley [**3-6**] cirrhosis and liver failure     Medications on Admission:  1.

Responded well to fluid resuscitation.  Admitted initially to ICU, where an EGD was performed on AM of hospital day 2.  EGD revealed duodenitis, no active bleed, no ulcer, Barrett's esophagus. In the ICU, was transfused 2 units pRBC, 1 unit FFP.  Given initial low BP and GIB, all antihypertensives were initially held, as was coumadin.Throughout the rest of hospital stay, pt. had stable vital signs, no further GIB.  Hct responded appropriately to transfusion, remained stable. Antihypertensives and coumadin were restarted on HD 3 and were tolerated well. Overall, continued ASA and warfarin, but stopped plavix after consultation with Cardiology. . Respiratory distress/asthma flare: On Hospital day 3, began to have increasing respiratory distress. Exam notable for marked wheezing. CXR with no definite infiltrates. While initially volume overloaded after MICU stay, no longer had evidence of CHF. Overall, he was treated with prednisone and nebs for asthma flare. Also empirically treated for PNA - although limited evidence for this on cxr - with rocephin/azithro. Will be d/c with levaquin to complete 7 day course. . Chest pressure: On the night of HD 3, patient had an episode of L-sided chest pain that was ssociated with diaphoresis and an increased 02 requirement (responded to 2L NC).  Pain resolved quickly with 3 SL nitroglycerin, albuterol neb, and IV lasix. Cardiac enzymes were trended and over the following day climbed from 0.05 to a peak of 0.08. He had no further events, and had stress MIBI in hospital prior to discharge, which again demonstrated his severe ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and also multiple predominantly fixed perfusion defects - previous stress in [**2137**] with progressively worse reversible perfusion defects. Will continue medicla management. . ARF on CKD: Pt. had briefly elevated Cr, which returned quickly to baseline with fluid resuscitation.  In setting of GIB, seemed c/w prerenal picture.  ACEI was initially held, but restarted without adverse effect once Cr returned to baseline. Remained at baseline thereafter with re-introduction of meds. . Abdominal pain/constipation: On HD 3, pt. developed bilateral lower quadrant abdominal pain, which he attributed to not having had a bowel movement since admission to hospital.  Abdominal exam was benign, KUB unremarkable. Had relief after BM. .   Medications on Admission: 1. Lasix 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day. 2. Aldactone 25 mg Tablet PO once a day. 3.

Brief Hospital Course: # Shock: The patient presented with hypotension with systolics in the 70s-80s compared to his baseline of 120s-130s in the outpatient setting.  His pressures did not respond adequately to fluid boluses.  A PICC line was placed and he was started on dopamine initially.  Dopamine was switched to vasopressin given concern for his recurrent ascites.  His shock was thought to be due to a combination of sepsis and intravascular volume depletion [**3-3**] recurrent malignant ascites. A definitive infectious source was never identified, though SBP was excluded with 2 large volume paracenteses. The patient was placed on vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl. He was also given stress dose steroids. Fluid resuscitation was performed with crystalloid and colloid without success. The patient continued to rapidly reaccumulate fluid in his abdomen. The patient remained oliguric to anuric during his admission. Norepinephrine was added on the day of intubation added without improvement in urine output. After a family meeting, the patient was made CMO and vasoactive medications were discontinued. The patient expired shortly thereafter.  # Respiratory failure: The patient developed tachypnea and increased work of breathing on the morning of his expiration while undergoing a CT head. He was intubated for respiratory distress, self-extubated, and was reintubated for continuing respiratory distress. Versed, fentanyl, and propofol were used for sedation. A CXR did not show any acute intrapulmonary process. Bilateral LENIs were negative for DVTs.  An ECHO did not show any RV strain.  Most likely etiology was worsening lung function in the setting of extensive RCC lung metastases and worsening metabolic acidoses due to renal failure.  A family meeting was held in the afternoon and the decision was made to make him CMO given his poor prognosis.  The patient was terminally extubated on the afternoon of [**9-12**] and expired shortly thereafter.  # Acute renal failure: The patient was oliguric on presentation. A renal ultrasound did not show impaired renal flow. Bladder pressures were consistently below 20.  Etiology was likely secondary to intraarterial volume depletion due to massive 3rd spacing of fluids secondary to ascites. Urine output did not improve after large volume paracentesis or after fluid resuscitation with crystalloid or colloid.  Patient became increasingly acidemic.  Dialysis was discussed and not considered appropriate given his poor prognosis.  # Metastatic renal cell carcinoma: The patient required 2 large volume paracenteses to manage his malignant ascites. His pain was managed with a dilaudid PCA.  Patient's outpatient oncologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] and informed of worsening status and the decision was made to not be aggressive with interventions given his worsening prognosis and lack of tumor response to multiple biologic therapies.  # Comfort care: Patient's Oncologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding transitioning to comfort care.  As noted above, his prognosis was poor given his lack of response to biologic therapies. Palliative care service was consulted.  Patient's family was called on the day of intubation and arrived in the afternoon. Discussion was had with the family as well as Oncologist NP and Palliative care and decision was made to terminally extubate. Patient expired peacefully in the evening.

She reportedly went to bed in her normal state of health at 2300. Her partner heard her thrashing in bed at 0130 and at that time, he noted her speech to be slurred and her left side to be weak, though apparently still able to move. As it seems that the thrashing likely was around the time of onset of the stroke, we considered 0130 to be the last known well time. She was initially taken to OSH, where she had a CT head that was negative for hemorrhage; it was there determined that she was ""out of the tPA window"" and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.  Full ROS unable to be obtained as patient very agitated and seemingly confused when providing her own history.

[**1-26**]: attempted MRI Incomplete examination due to lack of patient cooperation. Right basal ganglia hemorrhage/hematoma is again noted.   Brief Hospital Course: Initial Assessment:  Ms. [**Known lastname 104742**] is a 49 y/o woman with a PMH significant for myelodysplastic syndrome, HTN and hypothyroidism, who presents with sudden onset left sided weakness. On her exam, her NIHSS is 17 and she has a dense left sided hemiparesis as well as right gaze deviation, left hemianopia and neglect. Her imaging shows an occlusion of R MCA near its origin. Her history, exam and imaging are consistent with acute embolic stroke in R MCA. The time of onset was taken to be 0130; the time of her thrashing, and so when she was seen here, she remained within the window for IV tPA. The decision was made to proceed with the IV tPA. The plan at this time is to proceed with tPA infusion and if clinical exam remains unchanged in 30 minutes, then plan is to proceed with angio for IA tPA vs. Merci.  Neuro: Ms. [**Known lastname 104742**] was admitted to the neurology ICU, attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. There was no improvement with tPA, and she developed hematomas of the right knee, left scalp, and left clavicular area, so IV TPA was stopped. The team proceeded with angio and MERCI device was used. This resulted in opening of inferior division of the right MCA, but opening of the superior division was unsuccessful.  She was monitored in the ICU and then was transferred to the step down unit, then to the floor for further management. She was started on Aspirin 81mg and Lovenox 40mg daily (given possible MDS/malignancy.)  Her CT scans showed hemorrhagic conversion in the Right striatum and white matter. An MRI was attempted, but she was unable to tolerate this. There was no need to attempt repeating this MRI, per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] stroke attending. Imaging otherwise as above.  CVR: Blood pressure was controlled metoprolol 25mg TID and as needed hydralazine.  Her metoprolol was increased to 50mg TID prior to discharge.  She had an transthoracic echocardiogram which showed no ASD or LV thrombus. There was normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.  There was mild pulmonary hypertension.  A bubble study was not done.  A transesophageal echocardiogram was attempted, however Ms. [**Known lastname 104742**] developed methemoglobinemia (level 29) after receiving benzocaine spray. She received Methylene blue 140mg IV by anesthesia and had rapid clinical improvement. Her methemoglobinemia level was zero before returning to the neurology floor.  A transthoracic echo with bubble was later done which showed No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.  She had lower extremity doppler studies which were negative for DVT.  Hypercoagulable work up is pending at the time of discharge: antithrombin 3, prothrombin gene mutation, factor v leiden.  Heme: Due to her myelodysplastic syndrome and bleeding with tPA, heme-onc was consulted, and they did not believe there were any restrictions on her stroke management due to her MDS. Additionally, the team spoke with her outpatient hematologist who confirmed no need for epo or aranesp while in the hospital. Her HCT was stable during her hospitalization.  FEN/GI: She was initially NPO.  She was followed closely by speech and language team and was started on NGT feeds.  When able, a regular diet was initiated and advanced.  At the time of discharge she was tolerating a regular diet with nectar-thick liquids.  Her electrolytes were monitored carefully, and repleted as necessary. She received Famotidine for GI prophylaxis.  Psych/ETOH:  Initially Ms. [**Known lastname 104742**] had significant alcohol withdrawal.  She was on a CIWA scale and received multiple doses of Ativan in addition to Valium q12.  She also received thiamine and folate.  CIWA was discontinued and she had no further symptoms prior to discharge. She received Trazadone for sleep.  MSK:  Ms. [**Known lastname 104742**] had intermittent pain, especially in left shoulder.  She had an XR which showed no evidence of cortical disruptions suggestive of fracture or AC separation.  Pain was treated with tylenol and oxycodone.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after you had a large stroke.  You initially received TPA in attempt to break up the clot in your brain, however this did not improve your symptoms and you developed bruising.  You then had a MERCI retrieval which was able to open up part of your blood vessels.  You were started on medication, Lovenox, and Aspirin, to prevent further clots and strokes. You were also started on a blood pressure medication. You had multiple tests including head CT scans, attempted brain MRI, echocardiograms, and ultrasounds of your legs to determine the cause of your stroke.  Additionally, multiple laboratory tests were sent which are still pending.  While you were in the hospital you were treated for alcohol withdrawal.  You also developed a reaction to benzocaine spray, called methemoglobinemia, in which you developed breathing problems requiring treatment in the ICU.

He was noted to develop a VAP that speciated as pan-sensitive Serratia and he completed a course of pip/tazo, and also had a right-sided pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement. Per report, the patient was noted at rehab to have been progressively hypoxemic over the past 2 days with a outpatient CXR concerning for right-sided pneumonia. He did not have increased sputum production or fevers. He was then sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.  In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 98.1 62 92/54 18 95% 40% FM. CXR notable for right-sided complete opacification, for which the patient received vanco and pip/tazo. He was placed on volume cycled assist control, and was sent for a CT chest to rule out diaphragmatic rupture. While at CT, he received 5 haldol iv and 2 iv ativan for agitation, after which he was arousable to stimulation. He was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.  Currently, the patient is on mechanical ventilation, minimally responsive to verbal stimuli.  ROS: Limited given somnolence.  Past Medical History: Admitted [**Date range (1) 88323**] for 30 foot fall from roof.

Mesothelial cells, histiocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils.  Imaging Studies:  Chest CT without contrast ([**2156-12-20**]): 1. No evidence of diaphragmatic hernia. 2. Large right and moderate left simple pleural effusions. Consolidation and volume loss in the lower lobes bilaterally, right greater than left, may represent atelectasis however, aspiration or superimposed infection cannot entirely be excluded. 3. Healing rib and clavicle fractures, as described above. 4. No pneumothorax.  Chest x-ray ([**2156-12-21**]): In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been removal of a substantial amount of right pleural effusion with a small residual. No evidence of pneumothorax. Tracheostomy tube remains in place and there is again evidence of volume loss at the left base.  Transthoracic echocardiogram ([**2156-12-21**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve appears bicuspid with mildly thickened leaflets, eccentric closure point and fused right and left raphe. A gradient could not be assessed, but there does not appear to be significant aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. IMPRESSION: Probable bicuspid aortic valve with fused right/left raphe and no significant stenosis or regurgitation. Dilated ascending aorta. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function. If there is a clinical suspicion for an aortic dissection - a thoracic CT/MRI or TEE are suggested.  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 88321**] is a 48 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HCV cirrhosis and a recent admission for a traumatic fall with multiple IPH requiring bolt placement, multiple orthopedic fractures s/p surgeries, trach/PEG with hospital course complicated by Serratia pneumonia treated with pip/tazo now admitted for hypoxemia.  # Hypoxemia/leukocytosis: CTAP demonstrates a new right-sided pleural effusion with RLL collapse and volume loss throughout right side. Compressive atelectasis was considered, although could not rule out HCAP. With regard to new pleural effusion, LFTs were largely unchanged from prior, making hepatic hydrothorax unlikely. This may be a parapneumonic effusion with underlying pneumonia, or could also be from new heart failure. Would also consider chylothorax given history of trauma. The patient underwent thoracentesis on the first hospital day and 1.2 liters of exudative fluid were removed from the right pleural space. Cultures from the fluid came back negative, and the antibiotics were stopped. Trauma surgery was consulted who felt that the pleural fluid might be secondary to trauma. They recommended for repeat imaging in [**2-4**] days to see if the fluid was reaccumulating. Also, they recommended for repeat imaging if the patient develops any new respiratory symptoms. Interestingly, the fluid from the thoracentesis had an eosinophilic predominance (56% eosinophils). At the same time, the patient was noted to have a peripheral blood eosinophilia. This was all felt to be secondary to Depakote, which had been recently started. The divalproex was therefore stopped.  Notably, after the thoracentesis, the patient's respiratory status improved markedly and he was able to be weaned back to the trach mask. With regard to work-up for other causes of pleural effusion, a transthoracic echocardiogram did not show any cardiac dysfunction, and infectious studies, as above, all returned negative. Cytologic analysis showed no malignant cells. Antibiotics were stopped after the first hospital day.  Due to the calficifications noted on CT scan, a tuberculin skin test was placed to the right forearm on [**12-22**]. This should be interpreted on [**12-24**] or [**12-25**]. The spot of the PPD placement is marked with a bandaid.  # Mental status: His mental status remained at baseline, per family members and rehab facility notes. He was agitated and minimally interactive. He required prn doses of Haldol and Ativan for agitation. With regard to the history of traumatic brain injury, neurosurgery was consulted during this admission and did not feel there was any need for intervention. Head CT was deferred. He was continued on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis. Divalproex, as above, was stopped due to peripheral blood and pleural fluid eosinophilia.  # Anemia: Hematocrit was 35.8 on admission, baseline during last admission 27-33 with macrocytosis. His hematocrit remained stable.  # Orthopedics: Orthopedics was contact[**Name (NI) **] during this admission. Follow-up plans are outlined in the discharge orders.  # HCV cirrhosis: LFTs were at baseline.  # Depression: Continue home psychotropic regimen.  # Ulcerative colitis: Not currently treated.  # Nutrition: pnt recieved TF's FEN: TF. . # PPx: recieved Heparin SQ. . # Access: Double lumen PICC in LAC; this was removed during the admission as patient was no longer needing antibiotics or continuous intravenous medicines. . # Code: Confirmed FULL [**Telephone/Fax (1) 88324**]. . # Contact: [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 88325**] (Sister). # Dispo: ICU level of care, transferred back to rehab after the thoracentesis and improvement in respiratory status.

She was initially admitted to the MICU for monitoring and  while her HCT dropped from 29-->26, the patient had no evidence of hemodynamic compromise.  The patient was started on an IV proton pump inhibior and the gastroenterology service was contact[**Name (NI) **].  The the patient underwent endoscopy which showed erosive gastritis and deuodenitis.  Given the patient's history of chronic pain, NSAID induced gastropathy was the suscepted underlying cause. Because of the friability of the patient's stomach mucosa, no biopsy was obtained.  At the time of discharge, Anti-H.pylori IgG pending.  Over the course of hospitalization, the patient recieved 1 unit of blood.  She continued to have dark stools, but had no further episodes of hematemesis.  She was discharged with plans to continue a twice daily proton pump inhibior and a repeat endoscopy in [**1-22**] months.  She was to have a repeat hematocrit check in 1 week.  She was strictly instructed to avoid NSAIDs for pain control.  # HTN: Home dose of lisinopril was initially held due to her gastrointestinal bleed.  Throughout her stay, she was normotensive.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation and treatment of lightheadedness. It was felt that your symptoms were due to blood loss from bleeding in your stomach.  During this hospitalization, you underwent an  esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which showed an ulcer and stomach irriation. From your history, this was most likely caused by your daily use of ibuprofen. . Because of this irriation, you will need to take a medication (Omeprazole) twice a day for at least 8 weeks-- this will allow your stomach to heal.  It is highly recommended that you undergo a repeat EGD in [**1-22**] months and that you no longer use ibuprofen or other types of medications known as NSAIDS.  You may take Tylenol as needed for pain but you should let your doctor know if you need to take this on a regular basis. . Because of your bleeding, we also recommend that you follow-up with your PCP as soon as possible for a repeat check of your red blood count (Hematocrit) to make sure you have no further evidence of bleeding. . Your blood pressure was normal this hospitalization, we recommend that you do not continue to take your blood pressure medication (Lisinopril) until you see your primary care physician. .

His last dose was complicated by shock requiring dopamine and brief atrial fibrillation, spontaneously reverting back when dopamine was changed to neo.  His current course was given from [**2-29**] to [**3-4**] and has been complicated by nausea/vomiting, encephalopathy, diarrhea, rigors, and desquamation, but also by hypotension in the 70s systolic requiring neo for 90 min on [**3-2**] and restarted again on [**3-5**], ARF with decreasing UOP (355 total cc's on [**3-5**], none on [**3-4**], + ~ 14L LOC but without detailed recording of his UOP), and progressive metabolic acidosis despite bicarb infusion.

[**2124-3-23**] CT abd/pelvis 1. Small bowel dilation without a clear transition point to suggest mechanical obstruction. A 7 cm segment of small bowel wall thickening may represent ischemia, infection, or inflammation. A repeated CT with i.v. contrast may help evaluate the transit of oral contrast as well as the mesenteric vasculature 2. Nasogastric tube just passed the gastroesophageal junction. Consider reposition of nasogastric tube in the body of the stomach. 3. Metastatic disease, incompletely evaluated on this non-contrast study. 4. Bibasilar consolidative opacity concerning for pneumonia 5. Florid colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis. 6. Decrease in size of right adrenal nodule suggestive of response to therapy. 7. Extensive therosclerotis including coronary artery, abdominal aorta and mesenteric vessels.  [**2124-3-23**] MRI head 1. Near-complete interval resolution of the enhancing lesion within the left anterior temporal lobe. Only minimal residual enhancement and FLAIR signal hyperintensity persist. No new enhancing lesions are identified.  TTE [**2124-3-6**]:  The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.  TTE [**2124-3-8**]:  IMPRESSION: small pericardial effusion located mostly posterior to the left ventricle. There is minimal fluid anterior to the right ventricle. There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, which can be consistent with impaired ventricular filling but is more likely due to the irregularity of the heart rate. There is no frank tamponade seen. Normal biventricular function. No evidence of endocarditis although the valves are not well seen.  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-3-6**], this is a limited study. The valves are not well seen. The patient remains tachycardic but is now in atrial fibrillation. The size of the pericardial effusion is similar  Renal Ultrasound [**2124-3-6**]: 1. No hydronephrosis of the right kidney. Left kidney is surgically absent.  CXR [**2124-3-6**]: Lung volumes are lower, pulmonary vasculature more engorged, and distended mediastinal veins, unchanged, pointing toward volume overload or cardiac decompensation. A more focal opacity at the left lung base laterally would be better evaluated after hemodynamic status is optimized. It could be a small region of infection or infarction, pleural effusion, or transient atelectasis.  Heart is top normal size, though increased since yesterday. Right subclavian line ends in the upper SVC. No pneumothorax.  CT head/chest non-con [**2124-3-7**]:  Slightly decreased vasogenic edema in region of known left temporal lobe metastasis.  1. Extensive new strikingly peripheral/subpleural ground-glass opacities with a slight upper lobe predominance is highly suggestive of drug-induced toxicity (likely IL-2 drug-induced eosinophilic lung disease). The more confluent lower lobe opacities are most suggestive of atelectasis, although infection cannot be excluded by imaging.  2. Persistent findings suggestive of vascular engorgement with mild interstitial edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.  3. No significant interval change to some of the previously noted metastatic lesions with many of the previously noted foci obscured by the new lung parenchymal opacities. Slight enlargement of prevascular lymph nodes can be seen in the setting of underlying pulmonary edema/elevated CVP.  CXR [**2124-3-8**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, a new central venous access line has been inserted over the left anterior jugular vein. The tip of the line projects over the upper SVC. There is no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax.  The other monitoring and support devices are in unchanged position.  Also unchanged is the size of the cardiac silhouette and the bilateral multifocal parenchymal opacities. The retrocardiac opacity could have minimally increased in the interval.  Lower Extremity U/S: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity. Left peroneal vein not well visualized.  BAL:  Bronchial lavage, right mid lobe:  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.  Bronchial epithelial cells, pulmonary macrophages, and neutrophils; no viral inclusions noted.  CXR [**2124-3-11**]: Tip of the endotracheal tube is no less than 48 mm from the carina, standard placement for patient of this size. Diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality, more pronounced in the perihilar right lung has progressed could by virtue of asymmetry be pneumonia rather than pulmonary edema, although pulmonary vascular congestion is present. The heart is moderately enlarged.  Moderate right pleural effusion is stable. Right jugular line ends in the low SVC, left jugular line in the mid SVC, nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view. Mediastinal widening in the right lower paratracheal station is due to a combination of adenopathy and venous engorgement.  Portable Abdomen [**2124-3-10**]: FINDINGS: Supine AP abdomen radiograph demonstrates a nasogastric tube following a normal course and terminating in the distal stomach.

Shock: Felt initially most likely due to sepsis and he was covered broadly with antibiotics.  Initially broadened antibiotics to vanc/levo/cefepime to cover above sources.  Goal CVP was [**9-21**], MAP > 65.  Initial central venous O2 saturation was 91%.  Patient was transferred from floor to ICU on dopamine and neo; dopamine was converted to levophed.  Pulsus was normal at 5.  Echocardiogram as above, largely unremarkable. Hypotension persisted and was thought to be septic in etiology with IL-2 distributive physiology contributing.  Shock was refractory to fluid boluses; received normal saline and water with bicarb given renal failure.  Blood cultures eventually grew out MRSA, successive cultures negative until [**2124-3-10**], with [**2124-3-10**] culture growing vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. During this time, patient was actually weaned off pressors.  The right subclavian triple lumen was removed and a right internal jugular triple lumen was placed.  Goals of care were discussed with family, who requested continued aggressive treatment. Linezolid replaced vancomycin for VRE bacteremia. The patient's pressures stabilized and pressors were discontinued.  He did not have further hypotension after transfer to the oncology floor.  # MRSA/VRE bacteremia: S/p line removals; Patient completed 15 day course of linezolid.  Also added Meropenem on [**3-24**] given MS decline and asterixis.  Antibiotics were d/c'd on [**3-25**] and patient has been stable, afebrile without leukocytosis since. Repeat blood and urine cultures have been negative.  # partial/early SBO: On [**3-25**] patient developed worsening abdominal distention and confusion.  This early SBO was likely due to narcotics though concerning that is ongoing and limiting nutrition. MRI head with improved findings. An NGT was placed for 24 hours and the patient's MS cleared as did his SBO.  There was initially some concern for messenteric ischemia given guiaic positive stool, known necrotic fingers and subsequent CT abd findings, so GI and surgery were consulted.  Patient however soon improved clinically so further work-up with colonoscopy was not done.  He was able to tolerate a regular diet for 48H prior to discharge. A PICC had been placed for access and for ability to start TPN if needed, however TPN was never started.  # Anemia: likely multifactorial due to poor nutrition, acute nutrition, and marrow suppression.  Patient is also FOB+ s/p 2U PRBC since [**3-17**]. then another 1U [**3-24**].  He was continued on iron, folate and B12 on [**3-27**].  Mr. [**Known lastname 2795**] did have guiaic positive stools during admission which should be followed-up  by gastroenterology as an outpatient.  # gangrene: [**3-14**] pressors, shock as below.  Patient was treated with wound care and transitioned to a fentanyl patch with breakthrough morphine for pain.  # thrombocytopenia: Resolved. Likely due to myelosuppression.  # coagulopathy: Patient was supplemented with vitamin K X3 days to decrease his INR.  #  Respiratory failure- Patient was intubated electively in setting of persistent hypervolemia and renal failure. Maintained on minimal ventilatory support during dialysis. Patient received antibiotic coverage for aspiration pneumonia. The patient was extubated on [**2124-3-15**] and continued to improve significantly. The patient was called out to the OMED floor team for further managment.  #. ARF: IL-2 mediated ARF most likely, however prerenal or postrenal etiology also possible.  K wnl, phos elevated though stable from last draw.  Patient likely had IL-2 induced renal injury, with possible ischemic acute tubular necrosis.  Despite aggressive fluids, renal function did not improve.  Patient was showing signs of uremia and hypervolemia, and continuous [**Last Name (un) **]-venous hemodialysis was started following intubation and placement of HD line.  On the last days of admission he did not require diuresis and continued to auto-diurese with a creatinine of 1.1-1.3. He was not continued on his anti-hypertensives as his SBPs were 130-140. Mr. [**Known lastname 2795**] should have his renal function checked as an outpatient in the next 1-2 weeks. If there are concerns with worsening kidney function as an oupatient, he should be followed by renal.  #  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response- Occurred on morning of [**2124-3-7**].  Became more hypotensive, received two attempts at DC cardioversion, transient sinus rhythm restored, then converted back into a. fib.  Amiodarone load and drip was started.  Converted to sinus rhythm day later, maintained on amio drip.  Cardiac enzymes were flat, lower extremity ultrasound negative for DVT.  Repeat TTE showed no right heart strain. The amiodarone drip was discontinued and the patient remained in normal sinus rhythm.  #. HA/MS changes: Known metastatic disease to brain and IL-2 can cause swelling.  He is AOx3, though slightly agitated.  Clinical picture not c/w meningitis/encephalitis and most likely toxic-metabolic.  CT head showed slight improvement in metastatic disease, less vasogenic edema.  Lumbar puncture was deferred given intracranial mass.

The patient presented on [**2128-10-30**] with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.  The pain was described as being in the midabdomen and occurs in waves.  The pain began last night.  It was only somewhat relieved by Roxicet.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Past medical history is significant for esophageal cancer which was diagnosed approximately two weeks prior.  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:   Past surgical history as described above.  MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Medications included Prevacid, Roxicet, multivitamin, and calcium.  FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history is significant for a mom with ovarian cancer.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   On examination, the patient was noted to have a temperature of 98.9, pulse was 76, blood pressure was 148/70, respiratory rate was 16, and was saturating 98% on room air.  She appeared to be in discomfort and nauseated.  Her head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination was significant for extraocular movements which were intact.  Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  There was no icterus demonstrated. The oropharynx demonstrated mucous membranes were dry.  She was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart rate was regular in rate and rhythm without any associated murmurs, rubs, or heart sounds.  Her abdomen was distended, tympanitic, with percussion tenderness near the incision. Bowel sounds were hypoactive.  Extremities had trace edema bilaterally.  PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories obtained at the time indicated white blood cell count was 8.5, hematocrit was 51.3, platelets were 508.  Her Chemistry-7 demonstrated sodium was 138, potassium was 4.2, chloride was 98, bicarbonate was 29, blood urea nitrogen was 13, creatinine was 0.6, and blood glucose was 112.  Her liver function tests were normal.  RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A KUB obtained in the Emergency Room indicated free air consistent with her laparoscopic operation.  It also demonstrated gastric dilatation and one small air/fluid level in the midabdomen.  HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Purple Surgery Service and treated with antiemetics, and medication, as well as intravenous hydration for possible postoperative ileus.  On hospital day two, she was noted to have increasing amounts of gastric dilatation and increasing amounts of discomfort, starting at approximately 11 o'clock that afternoon.  She was subsequently taken to the operating room for re-exploration and revision of her jejunostomy tube placement.  Please see the Operative Note per Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for details of this operation.  Notably, during the course of this operation her course was complicated by a aspiration upon anesthesia induction. Approximately 2 liters of gastric content was estimated to have entered the lungs and was rapidly suctioned out; however, attempts at extubation failed, and the patient was ultimately transferred to the Intensive Care Unit with a presumed diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to her aspiration.  On [**2128-10-31**], the patient was maintained intubated in the Intensive Care Unit.  On postoperative day one, the patient was converted to a prone position in the Intensive Care Unit to help improve her respiratory status.  This gradually improved.  The patient was returned to a supine position on postoperative day two.  She was gradually weaned from the ventilator over the next several days until she was extubated on postoperative day eight.  On postoperative day seven, Pseudomonas pneumonia was grown from her tracheal tube.  She was started on ceftazidime and Zosyn that was ultimately converted from Zosyn to ciprofloxacin.  Tube feeds were started on postoperative day eight and were brought to goal by postoperative day thirteen.  The patient was transferred to the floor on [**2128-11-12**]. Just prior to discharge to the floor, it was noted that she had swelling in her right arm.  An ultrasound was undertaken to rule out deep venous thrombosis.  A thrombus was seen within the distal jugular vein; consistent with deep venous thrombosis from the right brachial vein to the subclavian. The patient was started on a heparin drip at that time, and over the next several days was converted toward Coumadin.  At the time of discharge, however, she was not therapeutic on the Coumadin; potentially from interference from the antibiotics she was on, so the patient was ultimately discharged on Lovenox.  On the final day of the patient's admission, her port was accessed.  She was discharged home on tube feeds at 120 cc per hour times 15 hours.  She was given oxygen therapy; predominately because of anxiety that she was dealing with over feelings of air hunger.  She was also given Lovenox injections.  All of this was accomplished through the aid of a visiting nurse who was going to help the patient with delivery of medications, the Lovenox injections, and the tube feeds, as well as assisting with monitoring Coumadin in concert with the local physician.  CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.  DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home.  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1.  Esophageal cancer. 2.  Status post jejunostomy tube placement and port placement complicated by small-bowel obstruction requiring re-exploration and jejunostomy tube revision, complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome subsequent to aspiration.  MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (Discharge medications included) 1.  Enoxaparin sodium 60 mg subcutaneously q.12h. 2.  Warfarin 5 mg q.d. (crushed and given per jejunostomy tube) 3.  Roxicet elixir 5 cc to 10 cc per jejunostomy tube q.4-6h. as needed. 4.  Ranitidine 150 mg per jejunostomy tube (as an elixir). 5.  Sertraline HCl 50 mg per jejunostomy tube q.d. 6.  Colace elixir 100 mg per jejunostomy tube b.i.d. 7.  Albuterol 4 puffs inhaled q.4-6h. as needed. 8.  Tube feeds were also given with Impact full strength with fiber at 120 cc per hour.  DISCHARGE DISPOSITION/INSTRUCTIONS:   Dressing changes were to be done every day on the jejunostomy tube site per [**Hospital6 407**].  An oxygen tank was also to be provided to the patient.  At the time of discharge, the patient was again receiving tube feeds at the above-mentioned rates over the above-mentioned times and was tolerating this without problems.  She was also taking full liquids at the time of discharge.  DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   Follow-up plans included seeing Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in approximately one to two weeks.

Because of his severe 3VD he was started on heparin and nitroglycerine drips for optimal control of his CAD.  He underwent pre-op workup including pre-op head CT (with hx of CVA) and carotid ultrasound. On [**2163-4-22**] he proceeded to the OR and underwent a CABG x 3 with LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the OM, and SVG to the Ramus with patch angioplasty and repair of ramus posterior rupture (subacute). Please see OP note for full details. He was successfully weened and extubated on his operative evening. On POD one he remained in the ICU for ongoing hemodynamic monitoring and on POD two he was transferred to the in-patient telemetry floor for ongoing care. In the early morning hours on POD three, Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 32994**] was found to be talking non-sensically and trying to get out of bed. A neuro consult, head CT and MRI were obtained for suspected acute CVA.  He was found to have small right parietal, left cerebellar, and right cerebellar infarcts thought to be embolic with new post-operative atrial fibrillation. Over PODs four and five Mr. [**Known lastname 32993**] continued to wax and waine; he was continued on his heparin and coumadin per neuro recs. On POD six his mental status was noted to be significantly improved with neuro recs only for ongoing anticoagulation for stroke prevention. Also on POD six he was noted to have new sternal drainage.  His WBC bumped up to 18 (from 13) for which he was pan-cultured.  He had continued bursts of atrial fibrillation and was started on amiodarone. On POD seven his sternal drainage significantly increased; due to his elevated INR, he was unable to return immediately to the OR.  On POD nine ([**5-2**]) his INR fell below 1.7 and he returned to the OR for sternal rewiring. On POD eleven he was found to be C. diff positive with multiple loose stools and on POD thirteen he was noted to have guaiac positive stools.  An endoscopy showed bleeding ulcers in the duodenal bulb accounting for the patient's GIB and hemostasis was obtained.  He was started on IV protonix with serial Hcts to monitor progress.  He was transfused as necessary and was taken off of his anticoagulation.  After two days in the ICU for close hemodynamic monitoring in light of GIB, he was again transferred to the inpatient floor on PODs 16 and 5. He continued to work with the physical therapy team throughout his stay but it was not felt that he was safe for home.  He was screened for rehabilitation. On PODs 20 and 9, a new rash was noted on trunk and Mr. [**Known lastname 32995**] antibiotics were discontinued.  The rash resolved and on PODs 24 and 13, it was decided that he was safe for transfer to a rehabilitation facility for ongoing management, treatment, and rehabilitation. Final recommendations from the neurology service are for coumadin as soon as cleared by GI with 325 mg aspirin daily until then; to follow-up with primary neurologist.  GI recommends re-starting Coumadin 14 days post bleed: [**2163-5-10**]. Start coumadin at low dose and keep INR at low-end of theraupetic.  Medications on Admission: Aspirin 325 daily.

This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..   Brief Hospital Course: 65 year old male with squamous cell CA of tongue, with recurrent disease and evidence of metastases and recent spread to spine who presented with worsnening dyspnea on exertion and weight loss.  The patient's chief reason for presenting to the ICU was multifactorial hypoxia due to his COPD, CHF, pleural effusion and probable aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.  On presentation he was started on levofloxacin for aspiration pneumonia. Nevertheless he continued to have worsening of his dyspnea and sputum production and during the day of [**2156-1-11**] he was noted to be increasingly hypoxic and his oxygen saturations were dropping to the 80's on 6L NC.  He was switched to 100% NRB and maintained sats in the 90's on that but appeared to be tiring and was transferred to the ICU on [**2156-1-11**].  At that point a blood gas revealed profound respiratory acidosis and he was then intubated for ventilatory failure.  The patient has treated with vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole for aspiration/HAP and was gently diuresed.  No microbiologic diagnosis of the patient's pneumonia was ever made and despite BAL no organisms were ever isolated.  On [**2156-1-13**] a thoracentesis was performed to evaluate for complicated effusion and this showed sterile inflammatory fluid consistent with parapneumonic effusion.  The patient did improve somewhat allowing some weaning of ventilatory settings and acutally self extubated on [**2156-1-14**].  Unfortunately, after extubation mental status remained poor and the patient became progressively more hypercarbic requiring reintubation on [**2156-1-15**]. On the morning of [**2156-1-16**] NIF was checked and was less than 30 suggesting generalized muscle weakness and high likelihood of ventilatory failure if extubated.  With this information, and given the patient had been reluctant to undergo chemotherapy in the first place and had expressed a desire to not be permanently sustained on artificial means, his husband and family decided to terminally extubate the patient and make him comfortable.  He was extubated on the evening of [**2156-1-16**] and gradually became more hypoxic before expiring of respiratory failure.  His husband declined autopsy.

He was admitted to OMED service, where ortho and rad onc were consulted.  He had MRI c-spine that showed mets involving c4-t2.  He was taken to the OR for laminectomy of T5-8, medial facetectomy, foraminotomy for extradural mass on [**4-29**].  On POD #2, pt triggered for hypotension w/ BP 90/60.  He also spiked a temperature to 100.7. He received total 2.5L IVFs, and was started on vanc and ceftaz.  His BP did not improve and remained 80s-90s/40s, w/ HR in 100s-110s.

[**5-7**] SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST: The endotracheal tube ends at the level of thoracic inlet, approximately 7.5 cm above the carina. The entire course of the trachea is not well seen. There is a linear lucency along the right aspect of the superior mediastinum which may represent an angulated deviated trachea versus air within the mediastinum. Other linear lucencies within the mediastinum are consistent with pneumomediastinum. Extensive reticular nodular opacities are again seen bilaterally, consistent with known metastatic disease. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Gaseous dilation of bowel loops are noted. IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for pneumomediastinum. Endotracheal tube ends at the level of thoracic inlet. Recommend further evaluation with chest CT. . [**5-7**] PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There is almost complete white out of the left lung, new compared to prior examination. The acute change is concerning for lobar collapse and a large pleural effusion, possible hemothorax. Multiple reticular nodular opacities throughout the remainder of the aerated lung is unchanged. The tip of the endotracheal tube is at the level of the thoracic inlet, unchanged from prior. No other significant change from prior. IMPRESSION: 1. New severe white out of the left lung, probably collapse and large pleural effusion, possible hemothorax. 2. Endotracheal tube at thoracic inlet, unchanged. 3. Stable reticular nodular opacities in the right lung.  Brief Hospital Course: The patient was initially admitted to the Oncology service and evaluated by the Ortho spine team. He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] Spine Surgery Service and taken to the Operating Room for the above procedure without complication. For details please refer to the dictated operative note. TEDs / pneumoboots were used for postoperative DVT prophylaxis. Intravenous antibiotics were continued for 24hrs postoperatively per standard protocol. The patient's pain was controlled with IV pain medications followed by oral analgesics once tolerating POs. The patient's diet was advanced as tolerated. The foley was removed on POD2. Physical therapy was consulted for mobilization. . On POD2 the patient was noted to have hypotension to SBPs 90's associated with tachycardia to 110's and hypoxia 90's on RA and a low grade fever.  At CT chest was negative for PE.  He was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring given his metastatic CA history and started on empiric IV antibiotics.  He was stable in the ICU and improved with IVF and transferred out to the floor. . On the floor, the pt was persistently febrile, although his fever curve was trending downwards by abx day 6. The plan was to continue an 8 day empiric course of vanc/ceftazidime, although Cx were all negative and even CT torso failed to reveal a source. Pain control became an issue, particularly left shoulder pain. Pt is known to have metastatic disease. He required enough short-acting pain morphine to warrant starting MS Contin, which was uptitrated. However, pt became more somnolent, but still complained of pain when he was awoke. He had episodes of hypotension to the 80s requiring boluses. He ultimately was given Narcan for his somnolence. He woke immediately, but began to complain of chest tightness. He was suctioned deeply for suspected mucous plug, but was intermittently desaturating, even on 6L NC. He was transferred to the MICU, where he was intubated immediately as was unresponsive and unable to protect his airway. . ===================== [**Hospital Unit Name 13533**] [**Date range (1) 26511**] ===================== . # Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Initial ABG revealed significant hypercapnia in setting of narcotics and altered mental status, so hypoxic respiratory failure was initially attributed to hypoventilation. As stated above, he was immediately intubated upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and continued on broad antibiotics. He remained on mechanical ventilation. It was then noticed that his endotracheal tube appeared high. On bronchoscopy a new necrotic obstructing mass was noticed in his airway causing tracheal deviation. It was unlikely to be procedure-related trauma, given appearance of the obstruction. Most likely the patient experienced an acute bleed of a necrotic tumor, which compressed his airway and led to inability to provide adequate mechanical ventilation. This ultimately led to his expiration. . # Hypotension: On the evening of arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient began to experience labile blood pressures, dropping to the 80s systolic while sleeping and climbing to the 140s systolic when awakened. He was given two 1L NS fluid boluses without change in his hemodynamics. Transient hypotension was initially attributed to the use of Propofol for sedation (subsequently changed to Fentanyl/Midazolam) and perhaps large amounts of pain medication that were slow to clear secondary to impaired liver and renal function. He was started on peripheral dopamine for pressure support. . # Acute Kidney Injury: Thought likely secondary to Contrast Nephropathy based on timing and urine electrolytes. He continued to have adequate urine output and his Creatinine trended down. . # Metastatic Adenocarcinoma: Suspected lung primary and known bony and liver mets. The patient had undergone 6 cycles of taxol/carboplatin. He also underwent a T5-8 laminectomy for suspected cord compression secondary to a spinal met on [**4-29**]. He suffered tremendous pain from his extensive disease, which was controlled with Fentanyl boluses in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. . # Coronary Artery Disease: EKGs obtained were consistent with prior and showed no evidence of acute ischemia. He was ruled out for myocardial infarction with two negative sets of cardiac biomarkers. . # Diabetes Mellitus: On oral anti-hyperglycemics at home, which were held. Fingersticks were checked q6h and insulin provided as needed. . # Anemia: Likely secondary to chronic inflammation from underlying malignancy. Hct remained stable.

Pt states that since d/c on [**8-9**] he has experienced progressively worsening weakness. He states that he has the most difficulty getting out of chair, changing clothes, not as much weakness at the wrists or ankle. No diplopia or blurry vision, no dysphagia, no headache or jaw pain. Pt denies any myalgias, no paraesthesis. On the previous hospitalization his cholesterol lowering agents were discontinued as it was thought that these could be the possible culprits for rhabdomyolysis. During that hospitalization neurology was consulted, and work up included nl TSH, elevated ESR, negative [**Doctor First Name **]. Pt's health has been deteriorating over the past year in the setting of a chronic post surgical would infection at the left foot requiring most recently vancomycin. He was started on zyvox 4 days prior to this presentation. Of note, during his prior hospitalization he complained of SOB and had an oxygen requirement. Echo demonstrated an EF of % and it was felt that he possibly had diastolic heart failure. He responded to gentle diuresis with subjective improvement in symptoms. Pulmonary was consulted at that time and recommended outpt sleep study. His hospital course results were also remarkable for persistently elevated LFTs. An MRI was planned to further evaluate but pt was unable to fit in MRI due to abdominal girth. . In the ED his labs were notable for elevated CK to < [**Numeric Identifier 4731**]. This was higher than the CK max at the prior hospitalization. He was given 1L NS. . ROS: positive for mild SOB which he says is unchanged since discharge - overall improved over the past month since starting diuretics; denies CP/palp/cough/diarrhea/rash.

CXR--Bibasilar atelectasis, cardiomegaly . . FINAL DIAGNOSIS:    RIGHT DELTOID MUSCLE BIOPSY (including snap-frozen tissue):  Acute, recent, and chronic myopathy (chronic active myopathy)  Acute myofiber necrosis.  Scattered degenerating and regenerating myofibers and scattered myophagocytosis, indicative of recent myofiber injury.  Increased endomysial connective tissue, increased frequency of internalized nuclei, and scattered split myofibers, indicative of chronic myopathy.  Scattered CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocytes, without direct association with pathologic changes.  Coarse lipid and mitochondrial staining in degenerating myofibers.  NOTE:  In addition to the findings identified in the preliminary report, these special stains identify coarse lipid staining in many of the degenerating myofibers, along with corresponding changes in mitochondria. While not specific, they are consistent with a metabolic myopathy affecting lipid metabolism, as can be induced by toxic agents and several drugs. They are consistent with effects of some cholesterol lower agents, especially combinations of agents in elderly patients. Diagnostic changes of an inflammatory myositis are not identified in this biopsy.  MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:  H&E stain: increased internalized nuclei and split myofibers; scattered myophagocytosis and frequent degenerating and regenerating myofibers, including atrophic basophilic fibers; moderate to marked variation in myofiber size; frequent small, round or angulated myofibers; scattered acutely necrotic myofibers having pale eosinophilic staining  Gomori trichrome stain: increased endomysial connective tissue in sites of greatest degeneration; no ragged red fibers; degenerating myofibers often show coarse staining of sarcoplasmic mitochondria  PAS stain: normal distribution of glycogen  PAS + diastase stain: no diastase-resistant glycogen  Oil red ""O"" stain: coarse staining of degenerating myofibers  NADH histochemistry: coarse staining of degenerating myofibers in a mitochondrial pattern (mitochondrial clumping)  ATPase (pH 4.3, 4.6, 9.5) histochemistry: type I myofiber predominant; atrophic myofibers of both types - predominantly type II; no diagnostic type grouping.  CD3 immunoperoxidase: non-contributory  CD4 immunoperoxidase: scattered T4 lymphocytes throughout specimen; not directly associated with individual myofiber injury  CD8 immunoperoxidase: scattered T8 lymphocytes throughout specimen; not directly associated with individual myofiber injury  CD68 immunoperoxidase: non-contributory  Factor VIII immunoperoxidase: normal numbers of vessels, including endomysial capillaries   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 64yo man with h/o TIIDM, CAD, Afib, and Gout, presenting  with myositis vs rhabdomyalysis, transferred now with tachypnea and hypercapnia and acidemia. . #  Respiratory failure  Poor ventilation due to progressive muscle weakness.

Hospital course: . Patient was admitted from ED to Neuro ICU for q1 hour neuro checks.  She had CTA/MRA/MRI which showed evolving L IPH of L basal ganglia and frontal lobe with IVH and evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus.  She had a L MCA coiling performed and an external ventricular drain placed on [**12-11**]. Started on cefazolin as prophylaxis for the drain. She remained intubated until POD 3. She spiked a temperature on POD3. Pan cultures and CSF sent.  CSF was concerning for infection with 250 WBCs. Started on empiric Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone.  Infectious disease was consulted and recommended cipro and c.diff checks. Continued to spike temps over her hospitalization and multiple blood, csf, and urine cx have been negative except for two urine cx's that grew GPR and Lactobacillus.  UTI's treated appropriately but continued to spike fevers. MRI was not concerning for infection. Eventually it was decided to hold abx for a presumed drug fever.  After stopping antibiotics patient remained afebrile.  She had hyponatremia and leukopenia on labs. Patient was fluid restricted and started on salt tabs. Patient's hct then steadily declined no source defined - guaiac negative.  Her neuro exam markedly improved and was doing very well with physical therapy. Patient was transferred to medicine service for workup of anemia and treatment of metabolic issues. . On the medicine service: . # Leukopenia:  The patient had a leukopenia on transfer. An ANC was checked when the WBC dropped to 1.8, with an ANC of 700. Etiology of leukopenia was likely lab error versus medication effect (Keppra, vancomycin).  She will have her WBC monitored as an outpatient. . # Anemia: On the day of transfer from neurosurgery, she was noted to have a 10-point hct drop from 30 to 20.  This drop was from lab error, as the repeat check was 26%.  Hemolysis labs were negative and reticulocytes were normal with an retic index of 1.8. There was no sign of bleeding and she was guaiac negative. . # Aneurysm rupture: Was stable on transfer. Coil stable without new pathology seen on MRI/MRA [**12-24**]. Patient's memory and weakness deficits were improving daily per boyfriend's report. The nimodipine was discontinued on [**1-2**] and the keppra was continued (will be on this until 1 month follow-up with neurosurgery.  She was discharged on Plavix 75 mg po qday and aspirin for coil per neurosurgery directions.  She was asked to arrange a follow-up MRI/MRA in one month and then see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] after that. . # Right-hand weakness/Cognitive deficits: Improving per patient and boyfriend. Only minimal weakness noted on exam with wrist extensors, all other strength was equal bilaterally. Patient is right handed and was still having significant difficulty writing at the time of discharge. Per OT notes, the patient's RUE function was improving and recommended outpatient rehab as soon as appropriate. Concerning the cognitive function, she was not at baseline at the time of discharge. She had improved during her hospitalization but experienced delayed responses and speech. She was discharged with plans for outpatient OT, PT and speech therapy. . # Anorexia: Patient reported having no appetite since the aneurysm bleed, but eating because she knows she needs to eat. Likely related to the aneurysm rupture, and should improve with time. Considered an appetite stimulant and suggested starting as an outpatient is appetite did not improve. Did not appear to be secondary to depression. She was encouraged to take in high calorie, smaller meals supplemented with ensure. Weight was stable. . # DVT: Right calf vein DVT at the level of the peroneal vein seen on doppler on [**12-24**]. On transfer to medicine was on ASA, plavix, and SQ heparin.  Neurosurgery requested that she not be started on coumadin for now, but aggreed to theraputic lovenox for a course of [**1-22**] months. She will continue lovenox until her neurosurgery follow-up visit and the issue of coumadin transition can be discussed at that time.

Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 44 year old man with ETOH abuse transferred from OSH with necrotizing pancreatitis, ETOH withdrawal and DTs, fever and GPC bacteremia. . #. Necrotizing Pancreatitis: Patient initially presented with abdominal pain and nausea and vomiting with lipase>3000 and evidence of pancreatic 20-30% necrosis on CT scan. US without stones. Surgery evaluated him and elected for conservative management. With high fever and level of necrosis, meropenim was started at the OSH. A 7 day course of this was completed. His abd pain is now mostly resolved. He has developed an appetite, but given the level of necrosis seen on the CT scan the mild DM that he has developed it was recommended by surgery that he get jejunal tube feedings for at least another week. After that time, clears should be introduced and diet advanced, and if not tolerated, TF resumed. He is followed by gastroenterology, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2523**] MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 86328**] for his crohn's disease and she will follow him for his pancreatitis as well.

Pt arrived to the ICU with significance somnolence, minimally responsive but protecting his airway. We d/c'd ativan drip and changed to valium PO as tolerated. Pt's mental status significantly improved and patient became more coherent.  CT head without acute changes. Continued MVI, thiamine, folic acid. Strongly encouraged ETOH cessation. At the time of discharge he was AAO x 3, awake, alert, and w/o any s/s of withdrawal. . # GPC bacteremia: Most likely sources include catheter related bloodstream infection given PICC line given TPN. Treated with vanco and [**Last Name (un) 2830**] for now while awaiting speciation and sensitivities, that returned as pansensative coag neg staph. He was given ceftriaxone to complete a 2 week course to end [**1-10**]. A midline was placed for this which should be removed after abx therapy is complete. . # Fever/leukocytosis: Likely multifactorial secondary to pancreatitis and bacteremia.  last check 14. . #B12 deficiency: The patient arrived to our institution on daily B12 injections, presumably from a newly diagnosed B12 deficiency. he received 1 week of daily injections, planning for 1 month of qweek followed by qmonth afterwards. . #Diarrhea:while on zosyn, the patient had severe diarrhea. infectious w/u neg. diarrhea stopped. . #crohn's disease:No issues.

He was transferred to the SICU intubated and sedated, NGT, right chest tube, JP drain and Epidural for pain. He was extubated on POD1, placed on 3L NC and humidified face tent with oxygen saturations > 90%.  His oxygen requirement increased requiring aggressive pulmonary toilet, nebs, and chest PT.  Initially he was hypovolemic, fluid challenge was given with a good response. Once his respiratory status improved he transferred to the floor on [**2125-10-15**]. On POD 6 ([**10-16**]) barium swallow negative for leak and diet advanced to clears which were well tolerated. On POD 8 ([**10-18**]), pt experienced acute R sided CP and RUQ abd pain, hypoxia, and diaphoresis. CXR demonstrated ptx. DART placed with bilious drainage, EGD showed necrosis at anastomotic site. Pt returned to OR for debridement gastric conduit and repair POD 9 ([**10-19**]) and admitted to TSICU postoperatively with CTx3, JPx2. Pt underwent EGD POD 14 ([**10-24**]) with healthy-appearing anastomosis. On POD 19 ([**10-29**]) pt undersent percutaneous tracheostomy placement. Pt noted to have persistent JP drainage. On POD 30 ([**11-9**]), pt underwent esophageal stenting and NGT was discontinued. JP output transiently decreased but subsequently increased after stent placement. On POD 46 ([**11-25**]) pt underwent EGD which demonstrated good stent position and endoscopically placed NGT.  He continued to have respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation, with tachypnea and agitation with any withdrawal of sedation.  His hospital course remained stable until [**2125-12-18**], requiring sedation and mechanical ventilation.

Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF OVERVIEW: 74-year-old male xfr'd to [**Hospital1 18**] for eval for CT [**Doctor First Name **] for aortic aneurysm but not a current candidate.  Had a syncopal episode in the CSRU and transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  On history, he was found to have had orthostatic symptoms at home over the past ~1 month since starting flomax.  He had self d/c'd this medication and felt better.  He was on nitro gtt in the CSRU and was urinating when his syncope occurred there.  On xfr to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he had mild orthostatic hypotension that was symptomatic originally, but asx after a fluid bolus of 1L.  The following day he was symptom free.  The leading dx for his syncope was felt to be medication effect from flomax/nitroglycerin.  Other diagnostic possibilities included bradycardia (? [**12-25**] amiodarone), volume depletion, vasovagal syncope (micturition).  Adrenal fxn was found to be normal on a cosyntropin stim test.  He was felt to be stable at this point in the workup and was transferred to the medical floor for further workup.  On the floor, the following problems were addressed. . 1. Dizziness - His dizziness was worked up as above in the ICU. He had a normal ECHO w/out significant valvular disease and was monitored on telemetry w/out events noted.  He was able to ambulate w/out any problems on the floor and was d/c on the day after admission [**12-25**] patient request.  Further diagnostic possibilities that could be followed up as an outpatient include: 1) CT/MRI of head to exclude stroke in setting of stenting of calcific coronary arteries 2) tilt table test 3) Neurological evaluation for more rare causes such as shy [**Last Name (un) **] syndrome. . 2. CAD - continued [**Last Name (LF) 4532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] in setting of recent RCA stenting.  held off on bblocker or ace considering his orthostatic hypotension but these could be considered as an outpatient if his symptoms resolve . 3.

Left femoral venous catheter has an unusually short intra-vascular course. 2. 4.6-cm rounded structure in the gallbladder fossa contains a dependent calcification and demonstrates no inflammatory change. This potentially represents a post-operative collection without surrounding inflammation or a retained portion of the gallbladder. Correlation with detailed surgical history is suggested. 3. Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis 4. Focus of air within bladder. Please correlate with history for recent instrumentation. 5. Severe vascular calcifications. . [**2148-7-2**] GI Bleeding Study: Blood flow images show normal tracer flow through the large vessels of the abdominal and pelvic vasculature. Dynamic images of the abdomen show tracer extravasation in the right upper quadrant likely in the hepatic flexure of the [**Month/Day/Year 499**] at the onset of the study. Over 72 minutes, there is relatively little transit of isotope reaching only the region of the mid-transverse [**Month/Day/Year 499**]; slow transit is typical of bleeding in the large bowel. IMPRESSION: GI bleed likely in the region of the hepatic flexure of the [**Month/Day/Year 499**]. . [**2148-7-2**] CXR: Exam is limited as the bilateral bases are excluded from the field of view. Where seen the lungs appear clear. Cardiac silhouette is slightly enlarged likely accentuated by positioning however is unchanged. Dense atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the arch. Osseous and soft tissue structures are unchanged. . [**2148-7-2**] Mesenteric angiogram by IR: 1. Extensive atherosclerotic disease, with calcification of multiple vessels seen on fluoroscopic images without contrast. 2. Right common femoral artery access was obtained. Atherosclerotic disease but patent right common femoral artery with contrast flowing through and around the sheath. 3. SMA angiography demonstrated no evidence of active extravasation, specifically within the right [**Month/Day/Year 499**] or hepatic flexure. Additional selective angiography of the middle colic and right colic arteries demonstrated no active extravasation within the [**Month/Day/Year 499**] or visualized portions of small bowel branches.  4. Celiac artery angiography demonstrated no active extravasation within the right upper quadrant. Specifically, no active extravasation is seen within the GDA. 5. Angiography of the hepatic artery demonstrated a 5-6 mm pseudoaneurysm arising off the right hepatic artery. This is likely an incidental finding. No active extravasation was seen from this into any biliary ducts or outside of the vessel lumen. IMPRESSION: No evidence of active extravasation on this mesenteric angiogram. . [**2148-7-3**] CTA abdomen/pelvis: 1. Suboptimal bolus limits evaluation for active GI bleeding, although existing high-density intraluminal contents suggests extravasation from prior angiogram. 2. Mild bladder wall thickening and surrounding fat stranding is suggestive of cystitis, correlate with urinalysis. Further, air seen within the bladder wall may relate to prior Foley placement but emphysematous cystitis is not excluded. 3. Extensive atherosclerosis, without aneurysm. 4. Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis and cholelithiasis in a gallbladder remnant without cholecystitis. 5. Left adnexal cystic lesion is not fully characterized on this study.  If warranted, a non-urgent pelvic ultrasound may be performed.  Brief Hospital Course: 67 year old female with SLE, DMI, HTN, ESRD on HD, paroxysmal afib s/p PV isolation x2, tachy-brady syndrome s/p pacer, PVD with SFA stent placement, and NSTEMI s/p DES to LAD and BMS to OM1 on [**2148-6-21**] on aspirin, plavix, and coumadin who presented with melena and BRBPR. . # GIB: Patient presented with melena and BRBPR, suspicious for either an upper or lower GI source. The EGD showed mild gastritis but no active bleeding. The flex sig was also negative for active bleeding. The tagged RBC scan was positive in the hepatic flexure, however when she was taken to IR for a mesenteric angiogram, there was no active bleeding. She continued to have melena so underwent an abdominal CTA (after prep for her iodine allergy), which was also negative for active bleeding. She was scheduled for a colonoscopy which was then cancelled due to her Afib with RVR (see below). Overall she received 8 units of PRBCs, 3 units of FFP, and 1 unit of platelets while in the ICU.  It was determined by the team that the colonoscopy can be deferred to the outpatient setting given her relative stability. . # Atrial fibrillation: S/p two ablations in the past, now with pacemaker. We continued her amiodarone but initially held her home metoprolol and diltizem in the setting of the GIB. She went into AFib with RVR on MICU day #3 so she was given IV diltiazem and metoprolol and her home metoprolol and diltiazem were restarted. However, she continued to have RVR and required a diltiazem gtt.  She was eventually transitioned to her home doses. . # ESRD: On Tues/Thurs/Sat dialysis schedule, which was continued in the MICU. . # CAD: Patient with NSTEMI one week ago s/p DES to LAD and BMS to OM1. We continued aspirin/plavix despite the GIB given risk for in-stent thrombosis one week out. This was discussed with her [**Date Range **] outpatient cardiologist. . # PVD s/p SFA stenting recently: Recent peripheral angiogram by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3407**] with angioplasty/stenting of the left SFA and angioplasty of the left tibial artery; had been on plavix prior to NSTEMI. She has 2 gangrenous toes, which appear similar to prior. Continued aspirin/Plavix. . # Chronic pain: Continued home gabapentin and dilaudid. . # Depression: Continued sertraline.  # Goals of Care: Patient expressing interest in rethinking her goals of care.  She is considering a do not hospitalize, but would like to talk things over with her family before making these decisions.  She will speak to her primary care doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**], about these issues. She had declined rehab while in the MICU and was very insistent on going home. Because she had good family support and very good insight into her condition, she was discharged home with close follow up by the MICU team. She felt weak at home and was not able to navigate her home as well as she would have liked. The [**Last Name (STitle) 2287**] case managers arranged for her to go to [**Hospital 1785**] Rehab from home the day after admission. The MICU team was in communication with the case manager and primary care doctor during the post-discharge period in order to faciliatate a proper disposition.

Carotid ultrasound [**8-7**]: FINDINGS: Minimal calcific plaque at the origin of both internal carotid arteries. The peak systolic velocities bilaterally are normal as are the ICA/CCA ratios. There is normal antegrade flow involving both vertebral arteries. IMPRESSION: Minimal bilateral ICA plaque, no appreciable associated stenosis, however (graded as less than 40%). . ECHO [**8-7**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis/dysnnchrony of the inferior and inferiolateral walls. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45-50 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2130-7-29**], biventricular systolic function is much improved with mild residual regional dysfunction. . CT Chest/ABD/Pelvis [**8-5**]: IMPRESSION:  1. Moderate-sized bilateral psoas hematomas extending into right iliopsoas muscle. 2. Minimally displaced fractures involving the right third through eleventh ribs and left third through sixth ribs. 3. Cholelithiasis without secondary findings of acute cholecystitis. 4. Bilateral predominantly hypoattenuating renal lesions some of which are too small to definitely characterize and others which are clearly simple cysts. Largest 3cm lesion on the right appears more solid and can be better assessed with a dedicated renal ultrasound on a non-emergent basis to evaluate for renal cell carcinoma. 5. Mild-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions with probable adjacent compression atelectasis. Superinfection cannot be excluded and should be correlated with clinical suspicion for underlying pneumonia. 6. Single 2-mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule. If patient is at high risk for intrathoracic malignancy this can be followed with a follow-up chest CT in one year otherwise no further surveillance is necessary [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 8773**] Society guidelines. . ECG [**8-9**]: Sinus rhythm. Occasional ventricular premature beats. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2130-8-8**] no definite change.   Brief Hospital Course: This 74-year-old male was initially admitted following an episode of collapse while at a casino. It is unclear whether this was a cardiac arrest but after 5 minutes of CPR there was evidence of a pulse and AED showed a viable rhythm with no shock advised. He was never defibrillated. During his fall, he hit his head and sustained a minor laceration to his forehead. At the OSH he was intubated and cooled as per protocol and loaded with phenytoin for ? seizures, a CT-head showed only small vessel disease with no acute changes. In addition, CT-[**MD Number(3) 85050**] OSH showed no evidence of PE and a borderline dilation of the aorta. ECG showed AF in 120s. He was tehn transported via [**Location (un) **] to teh [**Hospital1 18**] ED and was given a stat dose of Pip/Tazo 4.5g IV for LUL infiltrates present on CXR, was loaded with aspirin 325mg and clopidogrel 300mg, commenced on a heparin infusion and metoprolol was started. At this point ECG shoewd AF/A-flutter w/ 2:1 block and he was transferred to the CCU. Initial cardiac enzymes were TnT 0.44 CK-MB 26. And treatment for possible pneumonia was continued. He was cooled for 24-hours and there was no evidence of seizure activity on EEG following neurology review. An echo performed in the context of cooling showed a mildly dilated LA and severe biventricular systolic dysfunction with LVEF <20%. When paralytics were weaned, Mr [**Known lastname **] was seen to be shaking and tehre was no EEG correlate to suggest seizures. He was weaned off ventilatory supportand CXR showed resolution of the pulmonary infiltrates. Continued EEG monitoring was discontinued and neurology were happy that there was no evidence of seizures. He was extubated on [**2130-8-1**] and was neurologically appropriate. He required IV hydralazine for labile BP and his metoprolol was up-titrated. His HB also was noted to trend down and although stool was guaiac -ve it was gastroccult +ve and pepcid was changed to PPI. Klebsiella was grown on sputum from [**2130-8-2**] and IV ceftiaxone was started. He was weaned off the NG tube and by [**8-4**] passed swallow assessment and was able to eat and drink. He had mild pulmonary edema requiring Iv furosemide. Labetalol IV was titrated to BP and weaned. He complained of rib pain and a CT-chest showed bilateral psoas hematomas and minimally displaced rib fractures on 3rd to 11th ribs on R and 3rd to 6th ribs on the left. This also demonstrated bilateral renal cysts including the largest on the R which was more solid measuring 34x36mm and suggested o/p U/S to visualise. In addition there was evidence of bilateral pleural effusions and a 4mm L upper lobe pulmonary nodule which should be followed up with a repeat CT in 1 year. He subsequently developed delirium which required PRN haloperidol and there was no recurrence of his AF. He pulled out his urinary catheter on [**2130-8-7**] and failed trial without catheter resulting in replacement. A repeat echo on [**2130-8-7**] was much improved with mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis/dysnnchrony of the inferior and inferiolateral walls and LVEF 45-50%. Due to a rising WBC of 14 and positive urinalysis he was commenced on oral ciprofloxacin for a presumed UTI. There was evidence of a mild R carotid buit and carotid U/S demonstrated  mild bilateral disease. He was commence on amiodarone and warfarin and ECG showed persistent SR and PVCs. His confusion improved and he had a trial without catheter on [**8-11**] which was successful and was transferred to rehab.  # Neurological ?????? Mr [**Known lastname **] was thought initially to be potentially having seizures and was loaded with phenytoin although there was no EEG evidence of this. On neurology review, they were happy that he was not having seizures and one episode of shaking post weaning sedation was felt to represent rigors. Following extubation, Mr [**Known lastname **] improved well neurologically although he developed a delirium picture which was presumed likely secondary to acute illness. Head CT at the outside hospital showed no acute changes and although urinalysis x1 was positive, there has been no growth on urine culture. He also had urinary retention and the feeling was that this is likely contributing, as patient??????s mental status significantly improved after Foley was placed. Patient completed course of ceftriaxone after sputum culture positive for Klebsiella and CT showed atelectasis but no frank consolidation, in addition patient has no clinical signs and symptoms of pneumonia. Haloperidol was used PRN and he required minimal doses. On discharge he was only very mildly confused and generally oriented. . #. Cardiac arrest: Mr [**Known lastname **] had a collapse while standing at a casino where he had 5 minutes of CPR and AED showed no shockable rhythm. It is unknown if pt was truly pulseless or merely unresponsive. He was cooled as per protocol and although initial echo while cooled showed a depressed EF <20%, post-rewarming, this had increased to 40-45% which is very reassuring. Cardiac enzymes peaked at 0.44 on admission and have trended down since. No shocks were given throughout course. Only documented rhythms were AFIB/A-flutter, although has latterly been in sinus. He was given a loading dose of aspirin and clopidogrel and has been continued on these. He was commenced on warfarin and will be slowly increased with INR as of [**8-11**] 1.3. . #HTN: Very good BP control latterly although required IV labetalol/hydralazine as above for labile BP. We will continue on HCTZ, Lisinopril and toprol. . # Afib/A-flutter. On presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] Mr [**Known lastname **] was found to be in AF/A-Flutter and this has not persisted he was started on amiodarone [**8-9**] and warfarin was loaded although his INRs latterly have been low and he will likely need an increased dose. He need close INR monitoring and we are aiming for a goal range INR [**3-1**]. We will continue Toprol XL. On discharge he was in SR with PVCs. . # New carotid bruit noted - A new right carotid bruit was noted on [**8-7**] and Carotid series revealed minimal bilateral ICA plaque, with no appreciable stenosis (graded as less than 40%) and therefore there is no need for intervention at this time . # Rib/hip pain: Pt is s/p CPR and continues to have pain in hip/lower abdominal area. CT scan shows psoas hematomas which may be contributing to pain and multiple minimally displaced bilateral rib fractures. Mr [**Known lastname **] pain has been improving. . # New CT-findings. On CT-C/A/P there was evidence of bilateral renal cysts, the largest on the R which was more solid measuring 34x36mm and suggested o/p U/S to which should be arranged. In addition there was evidence of bilateral pleural effusions and a 4mm L upper lobe pulmonary nodule which should be followed up with a repeat CT in 1 year given his smoking history. . #Anemia ?????? Mr [**Known lastname **] was noted to have a small drop in HCt and this was trended and now stable. It is unclear whether this may be due to poor nutritional state and freq phlebotomy although guaiac stool was -ve, there was positive guiaic of gastric contents while intubated. He has now been started on a PPI which has been increased to [**Hospital1 **]. Of note he was rrecently treated for H Pylori according to wife so this may also be contributing. . # Leukocytosis: Mr [**Known lastname **] had pulmonary infiltrates on CXR and was treated initially with a stat dose of Pip/Tazo and latterly ceftriaxone when cultures of sputum grew Klebsiella. He had previously had low grade temps and has now been apyrexial. Most recently CXR showed atelectasis with no frank consolidation. All further cultures and BCs have been negative. He was started on ciprofloxacin for ? UTI when urinalysis was positive. . # Urinary retention: Pt pulled out Foley catheter and subsequent to re-insertion had urinary retention which resolves. He was voiding post trial without catheter on [**8-11**] although if he does go back into retention he will clearly need further catheterisation and urology follow-up. He was commenced on tamsulosin. . # Dyslipidemia: continue high dose statin  Medications on Admission: Lisinopril 5mg QD Prevastatin 80mg QD Vitamin D unknown dose   Discharge Medications: 1. Atorvastatin 80 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily). 2. Lisinopril 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: Hold SBP < 100. 3.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Rehab Hospital @ [**Location (un) 4047**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Possible cardiac arrest Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Pneumonia - klebsiella on sputum Urinary Retention   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane).   Discharge Instructions: You collapsed and received CPR on [**2130-7-28**]. It is unclear if your heart stopped but you did not receive a shock that we know of. some ribs were cracked during the CPR. You had a small heart attack during this episode. We treated you for a pneumonia with intravenous antibiotics. You also developed a blood collection in your pelvis from the blood thinners, this is getting better. Your blood count is low because of the pelvic bleeding and some bleeding in your bowels. You could not urinate after we took the foley catheter out of your bladder so we replaced it and started you on a medicine called Flomax to help shrink your prostate. We took the catheter out on [**2130-8-11**] although if you are further unable to pass urine you will have to have the catheter re-inserted and will have to be seen by urology as an outpatient. Medication changes: 1. Stop taking Pravastatin, start Atorvastatin instead to lower your cholesterol 2. Increase Lisinopril to 40 mg to lower your blood pressure 3. Start Hydrchlorothiazide to lower your blood pressure 4. Metoprolol Succinate 5. Start Amiodarone 6. Start Haldol to help you relax if you feel anxious 7. Start pantoprazole to protect your stomach 8. Start Aspirin to prevent blood clots 9. Start Coumadin to prevent a stroke from your atrial fibrillation. You will need to have blood drawn frequently to make sure the level is not too high or too low. 10. Start Tamulosin to help you urinate 11. Start tylenol as needed for the rib pain .

History is obtained by the patient's wife due to the patient being sedated from the ED.  Over the past few days prior to admission, the pt's wife notes that he had not been sleeping well at night due to increased urinary frequency.  However, other than feeling more tired during the day he had been overall doing well. On the morning prior to admission, the patient developed a severe headache, associated with nausea and several episodes of bilious vomiting. He was unable to keep down any POs.  Additionally, he had increasing confusion and agitation and so was taken to [**Hospital3 12748**]. In the ED there, head CT revealed hemorrhage of some of his brain mets with 2mm midline shift and mild hydrocephalus.  He received 8mg IV dexamethasone, 4mg IV morphine x 2, and zofran.  [**Hospital1 18**] oncology fellow was contact[**Name (NI) **] and transfer was arranged.  Of note, pt has had 2 recent admissions to [**Hospital1 18**] with nausea, vomiting, dizziness and dehydration. This was felt to be due to combination of Taxol and progression of CNS disease.  During admission Mr. [**Known lastname 79353**] was made aware that surgical resection of the cerebellar metastasis may relieve these symptoms, however, he has refused any kind of surgery on more than one occasion on review of the medial record. He was placed on 4 mg every 8 hours of dexamethasone and was discharged with home IV fluids and PICC line on [**2118-7-19**].  In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.5, P 60, BP 166/90, R 15, O2 sat 98% RA. Patient was agitated, but not talking or answering questions.  He was given 3mg of ativan for sedation to obtain a repeat CT head.  He brady'd to the 30s after receiving sedation, but HR improved up to low 100s spontaneously.  Repeat CT head was reviewed by neurosurgery and showed no change from OSH imaging, without hydrocephalus or risk for herniation. Additionally, it was felt there was no significant change since his last imaging 2 months ago.  Family declined surgical intervention, per his prior wishes.  He was given decadron 10mg IV and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for close monitoring.  On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient is somnolent and unarousable but appears comfortable.  His wife is at the bedside.  Past Medical History: PMH: 1. Metastatic melanoma: Onc hx adapted from recent onc clinic note by [**Doctor First Name **] [**Location (un) **]: Mr. [**Known lastname 79353**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] wide local excision and left parotid neck node dissection for a 6 mm thick melanoma of his left parietal scalp in [**2116-7-3**], with 3 of 27 nodes being positive. He received adjuvant interferon, but had a soft tissue recurrence in the left neck a few months into therapy. This was resected and interferon therapy was resumed post surgery until [**Month (only) 404**] of [**2117**], when he developed contralateral neck soft tissue recurrence treated with surgical resection and parotidectomy in [**2117-4-3**]. Pathology revealed 4 of 8 nodes positive, and a large lymph node measuring 1.7 cm in the parotid. His interferon therapy was discontinued at this time. A PET CT scan in [**Month (only) 216**] of [**2117**] revealed lung nodules and a 3.3 cm left inguinal mass. Head MRI revealed a single brain metastasis in the right corona radiata. He [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] CyberKnife radiosurgery to this lesion in [**2117-11-3**]. He began high dose IL2 in [**2117-12-4**], without response. He developed deep vein thrombosis in [**Month (only) 404**] of [**2118**], requiring Lovenox. Followup head MRI revealed disease progression in the CNS. He was begun on CTLA4 antibody protocol on [**2118-3-1**], with 6 week scan showing disease progression, particularly in the CNS, and he [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] whole brain radiation therapy started on [**2118-4-12**]. He completed a 4-week course of radiation on [**2118-4-22**]. Repeat CT scan showed evidence of disease progression, particularly in the left inguinal area. Mr. [**Known lastname 79353**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] surgical resection of a mass in his left groin area in [**2118-5-4**]. Surgery was able to remove the mass.

Large nodule in the right mid lung unchanged since [**Month (only) 547**]. Heart size normal. No appreciable pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.  EKG [**2118-8-14**]: Sinus tachycardia, rate 140. Vertical axis. Cannot exclude inferior myocardial infarction of indeterminate age. S1-Q3-T3 pattern. Consider acute pulmonary embolism. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2118-8-14**] sinus bradycardia has given way to sinus tachycardia and axis is now vertical. Also, non-specific inferolateral repolarization changes have appeared.  HEAD CT [**2118-8-14**]: No new focus of hemorrhage. Overall unchanged picture of hemorrhagic metastases.   Brief Hospital Course: 1. ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Most likely multifactorial but primarily from leptomeningeal involvement and hemorrhagic brain metastases with contributions from over-sedation from home benzodiazepines, PNA and UTI. On admission to the ICU patient was quite sedated and only minimally responsive. Across his stay he became more responsive and was able to follow commands, move all extremities, and at times speak quite coherently, although his mental status continued to wax and wane. During his hospitalization he also developed a left sided facial droop thought likely due to evolving brain metastases and leptomeningeal involvement.  2. GOALS OF CARE/CODE STATUS: The patient code status was made DNR/DNI during this admission and this was confirmed with the patient's wife. A family meeting was held to discuss goals of care, and it was decided to move towards hospice care after discharge. The patient's wife, however, appeared to hold out ongoing hope for the patient's recovery, and the patient himself expressed the desire to attempt one more round of Taxol. Discharged with home VNA and bridge to hospice.  3. METASTATIC MELANOMA WITH HEMORRHAGIC BRAIN METS: Known mets to scalp, neck, groin, brain s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 16859**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] mass resection and ventriculostomy for obstructive hydrocephalus. On Taxol at admission, first dose 5/26.  In previous discussions, patient has been clear that he did not desire further surgical intervention for control of his brain mets. He repeatedly stated his desire for one more attempt at treatment with Taxol, which was decided against given the patient's disease progression despite taxol therapy. Dexamethasone was continued for cerebral edema and all anticoagulation was held.  4. FEVERS/PNA/UTI: Fever and CXR on admission with consolidation at right base concerning for aspiration pneumonia, as well as WBCs in U/A. No elevation of WBC. Started on Vanc/Zosyn later changed to Vanc/Cefapime after blood cultures remained negative. Urine Cx grew out enterococcus which was sensitive to ampicillin, nitrofurantoin and vancomycin.  5. NAUSEA/VOMITING: Likely related to leptomeningeal involvement and metastatic impingement on fourth ventricle versus recent chemo. No evidence of increased intracranial pressure on head CT but during stay patient did develop left sided facial droop. Could be related to vertigo in setting of additional brain edema as in recent admission. He also has had dizziness and lighthededness with standing and sitting up, and on previous admission patient had orthostatic hypotension. Patient was treated with Ondansetron and Decadron.  6. h/o DVT: Dx in [**2-11**]. Lovenox stopped on admission given hemorrhagic brain mets.

Brief Hospital Course: 34 y/o F with h/o generalized dsytonia, orthostasis, gastroparesis, bladder areflexia s/p urostomy who presented to the hospital with epigastric pain and transaminitis, UTI. . 1)Transaminitis: The patient presented to the hospital with sharp epigastric pain and transaminitis on [**8-25**] with ALT/AST in the [**1-/2120**]'s. During the hospitalization, the ALT and AST trended down. The epigastric pain resolved by the day after admission. Several etiologogies were considered for this acute change in her liver status.  Patient denies using tylenol or NSAIDs, and tylenol level was not elevated. The only new medication used was Valtrex for shingles in early [**Month (only) 596**], given the time that has passed between using the medication and transaminitis, it is unlikely that this contribued.The patient also had viral serologies, Hep A/B/C were all negative. CMV was negative. EBV showed positive IgG and negative IgM. parvovirus and HSV were negative. Additionally, the patient had autoimmune work up, whcih was negative for RH, alpha 1 antitrypson, cerruloplasmn. HSV, [**Doctor First Name **] parvo also negative. The patient is status post cholecystectomy, and had a MRCP for the consideration of stone in duct. Sludge was found, pt had sphincerotomy, and sludge was removed. On [**8-31**], patient complaining of repeat abd pain, now central on right side. Had KUB, was normal, had EGD which was normal, small area of gastritis, Small bowel follow through, normal. Pt has been on TPN for several years, this was discontinued during the beginning of the hospital stay. it was restarted on [**9-8**], and LFTs did not increase at first, but around [**9-1**] they started increasing slightly but consistently. It is likely that patient had a stone that was passed, which caused the initial pain patient felt before coming to the hosptital. Since the Liver enzymes trended up, she got a liver biopsy on [**9-9**].  Pt's liver enzymes have been trending down. . 2) Autonomic Dystonia: longstanding since age 23, at baseline uses wheelchair, exacerbations in setting of infectious processes or without clear inducing agents noted. Per movement disorder specialists her exam has shown severe dystonia with some atypical features that raise a question of a psychogenic component as well. During her first week here, while she had the UTI, she had about 3 episodes of acute dystonia during which she could not speak. The first was her first night in the hospital ([**8-25**]). When contrast for CT scan was done, she became acutely dystonic. She got 5mg IV valium, and then 10mg IV valium plus 25mg IV benedryl. She became unresponsive, and was transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring. She was transferred back to the floor the next day. She had another episode overnight, which resolved with 10mg IV valium x2 and 25 benedryl x2. This regimen has been working for during the hospitization. For less sever dystonia, she takes valium 5mg IV. Also during this hospitalization, with neurologies approval, Sinemet was restarted. she was taken of this medication a few months back. Pt will be d/cd with PO valium 5mg Q8 prn severe dystonia and 25mg benedryl po.  She must not take these medications in combination with her narcotic pain medications or other sedating medications. She will be following up with hepatology and neurology as outpatient for further care. . 2. Ileoconduit infection: patient found to have pan resistent klebsiella in urine in outside hospital. Put on 7 days of meropenem. Showing signs of infection again on [**8-5**], but Cx was contaminated. started on meropenem again. Patient has outpatient follow up appt with ID, who saw her in the hospital. Also seen by Urology, she should follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **], neurourologist for issues concerning ileoconduit, and removal of badder stimulator that is no longer in use. She will be following up with ID and urology as outpatient. . 3. Diarrhea: since [**9-5**] patient has been complaining of blood in stool and diarrhea. She has had 3 episodes of fecal incontinence. Stool studies were negative. Diarrhea has resolved. . 4. Pain control: patient prescribed Methadone 5mg q8h at home, but says she rarely takes it. She had significant RUQ pain during her second week here, requiring 4mg morphine every 4 hours. I started her on methadone 2.5 Q8h, and changed her morphine to 2mg q2h. She is requiring less PRN morphine since starting the methadone. She will be discharged home on methadone 2.5mg [**Hospital1 **], and morphine IR 15mg Q8 prn as needed for severe pain.  4.

EGD 2. Post-pyloric feeding tube x 3 3. Paracentesis 4. PICC line placement x 2  History of Present Illness: 45F with ESLD secondary to EtOH, AIHA due to lasix recently on prednisone who was initially presented to OSH with hepatic encephalopathy transferred from OSH on [**5-27**] for liver transplant evaluation whose course has been complicated by coagulopathy with recurrent epistaxis, VRE bacteremia, new onset Afib with RVR and now with worsening leukocytosis and diffuse bilat pulmonary infiltrates. . To summarize her recent course, the patient was admitted to OSH from [**Date range (1) 74368**] for hemolytic anemia thought to be [**1-15**] lasix and was started on prednisone 50mg. On [**5-22**], she represented with hepatic encephalopathy and T [**Age over 90 **]F where she underwent paracentesis with negative cultures. CXR showed b/l infiltrates and she received tx with vanco, levoflox, and zosyn and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for liver transplant eval. . At [**Hospital1 18**], she was noted to have numerous small pulmonary nodules on [**5-29**] chest CT of unclear significance. Pulm consulted for ?bronch given concern for infection vs. malignancy. Due to worsening confusion the patient underwent repeat paracentesis with 135 WBC. Eventually blood cultures from [**6-11**] returned [**12-17**] bottles +ve for VRE and was started on daptomycin. Likely source was colonization of urine discovered on [**5-30**]. Also on [**6-11**], the patient was started on CTX for positive U/A which was then continued per ID to empirically cover possible SBP. Also treated for hepatorenal syndrome (cre 1.5 which improved to 0.4) with albumin, midodrine, and octreotide x 4 days, which was d/c'd on [**6-16**] given improvement in renal function. . On [**6-14**], the patient developed significant epistaxis requiring multiple FFP, platelet, and RBC transfusions. There was concern for aspiration given altered mental status. Despite continued G+ black stools her Hct has been stable since [**6-15**]. On [**6-16**], the medical team repeated her CT chest to eval for progression of pulmonary nodules and found bilateral infiltrates concerning for infection, bleeding, or aspiration. She was started on bactrim for possible PCP given her recent prolonged predinsone course that had been discontinued on [**6-15**]. Also on [**6-16**] developed new-onset Afib with RVR 150s that responded to diltiazem. Due to increased volume of diarrhea and climbing WBC count she was started on empiric flagyl on [**2106-6-17**]. . On transfer to the MICU, the patient denies any complaints including shortness of breath, chest pain, headache, confusion.

RADIOLOGY: ========= [**5-28**] ABD U/S- DOPPLER LIVER ULTRASOUND: No prior studies are available for comparison. The TIPS is patent with wall-to-wall color flow. There is appropriate flow reversal (hepatofugal) within the left portal vein. The assessment of the right anterior and posterior portal veins was limited as the liver is extremely shrunken and nodular. The following velocities were obtained: Main portal vein 35 cm/sec; proximal TIPS 67 cm/sec; mid TIPS 73 cm/sec; distal tips 74 cm/sec. The receiving hepatic vein is patent. . There is a small amount of ascites surrounding the liver, relatively less in the lower quadrants. The liver is extremely shrunken and nodular with very heterogeneous echotexture. Anterior to the TIPS stent are multiple tubular hypo-to-anechoic structures which could represent dilated ducts or less likely, thrombosed veins. No frank mass lesion is identified but assessment is limited due to the shrunken appearance of the liver. The spleen is within normal limits in size measuring 10.7 cm. . IMPRESSION: 1. Patent TIPS with wall-to-wall flows and appropriate velocities as listed above. 2. Shrunken cirrhotic liver without overt hepatic mass. Questionable biliary dilatation anterior to TIPS stent . [**5-29**] CT A/P- IMPRESSION:  1. Numerous noncalcified subcentimeter nonspecific pulmonary nodules. Comparison with prior CT scans if available is recommended to evaluate for stability. If no prior examinations are available for comparison, and the patient is a high risk patient i.e. is a smoker or has a known primary malignancy, a followup with CT of the chest in [**5-25**] months is recommended. If the patient is at low risk i.e., is not a smoker or has no known malignancy, followup with CT of the chest in twelve months is recommended.  2. TIPS in the right hepatic lobe.  3. Chronic occlusion of the left portal vein and posterior division of the right portal vein with corkscrew hepatic arteries which are patent. There is a tiny left hepatic artery off of the proper hepatic artery with an accessory branch off the left gastric artery. No suspicious hepatic lesions.  4. Moderate intraabdominal and intrapelvic ascites with extensive intraabdominal varices as described consistent with portal hypertension. . ECHO (TTE) [**2106-6-1**]- Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic gradient is likely related to high cardiac output. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. . IMPRESSION: Normal/hyperdynamic biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation. Trivial aortic regurgitation. . Portable CXR [**6-4**]: Cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged.  NG tube tip is below the diaphragm out of view.  Right PICC line tip is in the mid SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.  New ill-defined opacity in the left lower lobe in the retrocardiac area is consistent with atelectasis and/or area of aspiration Small left pleural effusion is also new. . CT Chest [**6-8**]: IMPRESSION: 1.  Interim improvement in diffuse predominantly peribronchiolar nodular opacities, though numerous nodular opacities persist on the current study. The coalescing airspace disease adjacent to the minor fissure appears much improved.  Given the improved appearance over the short interval, an infectious process is considered likely.  Eventual CT followup (three months) is recommended after treatment. 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and moderate-to-large ascites as well as subcutaneous edema are unchanged from the prior exam. . Abdominal U/S [**6-11**]: IMPRESSION: 1.  Moderate to large amount of ascites.  A spot was marked for paracentesis to be performed by the clinical service. 2.  _____ TIPS unchanged from the prior studies. 3.  Cirrhotic liver.  No focal lesions identified. . Portable CXR [**6-14**]: IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2106-6-12**]: Pulmonary vascular congestion has worsened and new opacification at the lung bases is probably a combination of atelectasis and mild edema.  Pleural effusion is small, on the left, unchanged acutely.  Heart size is top normal. Left PIC catheter ends at the superior cavoatrial junction.  Esophageal tube and right PIC line have been removed. . ECHO [**6-15**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.  The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic function  is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic gradient is likely related to high cardiac output. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion. . Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-6-1**], the tricuspid regurgitation is somewhat increased. . If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis. . [**6-16**] Chest CT FINDINGS: Since the prior study there has been marked worsening of the alveolar opacities involving both lungs, predominantly in the upper zones. The periphery of the lungs is relatively spared. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. The heart size appears slightly enlarged. There is no pericardial effusion. There are borderline lymph nodes in the paratracheal region measuring up to 9 mm in short axis. The central airways are patent without endoluminal lesions. A left-sided PICC is seen extending into the superior vena cava. . In the visualized upper abdomen again seen is a cirrhotic liver with the TIPS shunt in place. There is a large amount of ascites noted. Coils are noted in the region of the splenic vessels. The osseous structures appear unremarkable. . IMPRESSION: 1. Marked worsening of bilateral extensive alveolar opacities particularly centrally. The rapidity of development and distribution is most concerning for pulmonary edema, however, atypical infection or less likely pulmonary hemorrhage cannot be excluded. Small bilateral pleural effusions. 2. Cirrhotic liver with a moderate amount of ascites and TIPS shunt in place. . OTHER STUDIES: ============== EGD [**2106-6-2**] - Grade 1 esophageal varices A trans-endoscopic NJ feeding tube (8 fr) was placed to 120 cm. Otherwise normal EGD to second part of duodenum.  Brief Hospital Course: 45 yo female with ESLD [**1-15**] EtOH cirrhosis s/p TIPS who presented from OSH for liver transplant evaluation, recent severe bleeding, who developed sepsis, DIC, and multiorgan failure. A brief hospital course by problem is outlined below: . #Sepsis/DIC: The patient required multiple vasopressors to maintain SvO2 >70 and MAP>60s. Lactate continued to rise and she became progressively acidotic. End organ hypoperfusion was demonstrated by anuria. She was treated broadly with antibiotics and aggressively transfused with blood products and albumin for intravascular volume support and to correct her underlying coagulopathy. HCO3 was utilized prn given worsening acidosis. The patient was made CMO after an extensive family discussion regarding her poor prognosis and she rapidly expired after removal of vasopressors and respiratory support. . # Respiratory Failure: Progressively worsening bilateral lung infiltrates resulting in hypoxia requiring intubation. Differential included DAH given coagulopathy, infection (e.g. PCP/fungal given recent course of steroids), or TRALI (though unlikely). She was afebrile with rapidly progressive leukocytosis. The patient was treated with steroids and bactrim for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 74369**] for fungal coverage, and levaquin to cover mycoplasma, and flagyl for anaerobic coverage. Given worsening infiltrates and P/F ratio suggestive of ARDS, she was ventilated on ARDSnet protocol to minimize barotrauma and allowed permissive hypercapnea. . # Acute renal failure: Cr progressively worsened in the setting of sepsis and the patient became anuric. Differential included HRS, ATN [**1-15**] renal hypoperfusion, prerenal [**1-15**] hypoalbuminemia and 3rd spacing. She was unable to take po octreotide, midodrine due to increased GI secretions and poor absorption. Attempted to increased intravascular volume with albumin and blood products. Pressors were utilized to maintain renal perfusion. The patient developed a severe lactic acid metabolic acidosis due to tissue hypoxia requiring HCO3 pushes. . # ETOH Cirrhosis: Decompensated liver disease s/p TIPS, with hepatic encephalopathy, coagluapathy, elevated Tbili, hyponatremia. On admission, aldactone held given hyponatremia and hypotension. Lasix held given auto-immune hemolytic anemia. She was given lactulose and rifaxamin for hepatic encephalopathy. Ultrasound perfomed on admission and showed patent TIPS, cirrhotic liver, no hepatoma. Diagnostic paracentesis was performed, and was negative for SBP. . During hospitalization, she was evaluated for liver transplant, and was transiently placed on the transplant list but was removed after becoming septic. TTE showed a hyperdynamic EF, with no pulmonary hypertension or significant valvular disease. Liver CT completed. PFT's performed, with noted mild diffusion abnormality. Chest CT demonstrated pulmonary nodules (see below) which were stable on repeat CT chest one week later.  Chest CT from [**2106-6-16**] showed marked worsening (see below). . Hospitalization was complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, hyponatremia and hepatorenal syndrome.  HRS improved after midodrine and octreotide, and albumin steadied hyponatremia near baseline of 127-129.  She was fluid restricted, but continued to have worsening peripheral edema; diuretics were held given her recently diagnosed AIHA [**1-15**] lasix. . # Arrhythmia: The patient had two asymptomatic episodes of stable Vtach on the floor. On [**2106-6-16**], pt developed atrial fibrillation to 160's.  She was converted with lopressor and diltiazam, but then reverted to Afib/flutter rate-controlled on diltiazem.  On transfer to the MICU, she had bursts of atrial flutter with variable block and rate-dependent bundle branch block.  She remained asymptomatic but nodal agents were held given hypotension. . # Leukocytosis: Initially with nosocomial pneumonia at outside hospital treated with a course of IV antibiotics. Upon admission to [**Hospital1 18**], no infectious etiology was found, with negative blood, urine and stool cultures. Although pulmonary nodules were seen on chest CT, this was not felt to represent an acute infectious process given lack of associated signs or symptoms of infection, therefore no further antibiotics were given.  Acute alcoholic hepatitis was considered as a possible cause of leukocytosis, however there was no recent alcohol use to go along with this diagnosis. . On [**6-5**], UCx with VRE.  On [**6-11**], pt's blood cultures positive for VRE.  Felt that PICC line was possible source; however, wound tip culture showed no growth.  She was started on daptomycin and ceftriaxone per ID.  Echocardiogram was negative for vegetation.  On [**6-16**], a repeat chest CT was performed for further characterization of pulmonary nodules which revealed the interval development of diffuse hazy opacities thought to be consistent with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 7470**] given that she was weaned off steroids for AIHA only days earlier. She was started emperically on treatment doses of bactrim however she continued to worsen. Diagnostic bronchoscopy was considered upon transfer to the ICU however the patient was too unstable for the procedure. Flagyl also emperically started for C. diff. . # Coagulopathy: [**1-15**] liver disease. Pt has had multiple red blood cell transfusions, FFP, cryo, and platelets during admission. Also received ddAVP for uremic platelets.  She had an episode of profuse epistaxis in the setting of trauma from Doboff feeding tube that could only be controlled with packing, Afrin and pressure by ENT.  She also bled from her paracentesis site, requiring transfusion and sutures. She developed DIC and diffuse mucosal bleeding after becoming septic. . # Auto-Immune Hemolytic Anemia: Diagnosed with auto-immune hemolytic anemia at outside hospital, felt to be secondary to lasix. Re-consulted hematology here who agreed with this diagnosis. Lasix was held during admission and repeat coombs antibody negative. Reticulocyte count high on admission (29%), with elevated LDH, tbili, and decreasing hematocrit suggestive of ongoing hemolysis. However, hemolysis indices improved on prednisone, and slow prednisone taper initiated as indices stabilized. Blood counts supported as needed with blood transfusions (for hgb <7 given difficult crossmatch (she has two antibodies). . # GI: EGD performed on this admission demonstrated grade 1 esophageal varices, a trans-endoscopic NJ feeding tube, and otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum. .

105383,"Admission Date:  [**2178-1-7**]       Discharge Date:   Service:  GEN SURGER  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85 year old woman who presents for a right hemicolectomy for resection of carcinoma of the cecum.  The patient was initially found to be anemic on routine physical examination by her primary care physician and further workup included a colonoscopy which revealed a mass in the cecum as well as diverticulosis.  The mass was biopsied and revealed an adenoma with high grade dysplasia.  The patient admits to intermittent melena, no bright red blood per rectum.  She has mild constipation, no diarrhea, no weight loss, no fevers or chills, no history of chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, syncope, nausea or vomiting.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1.  Hypertension. 2.  Breast cancer in the past which was resected and she had a left mastectomy in [**2152**], and a right lumpectomy in [**2168**].  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1.  Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.d. 2.  Butoptic one to two drops to each eye b.i.d. for prevention of glaucoma. 3.  Trusopt 2% one drop each eye for prevention of glaucoma which runs in her family.  SOCIAL HISTORY:  Significant for thirty pack year history of tobacco.  She quit fifteen years ago.  Socially ETOH, less than two drinks per week.  She lives alone in [**Location (un) 686**].  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On review of systems, she does get short of breath upon walking one flight of stairs.  Otherwise, the review of systems was noncontributory.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, her temperature was 97.8, heart rate 100, blood pressure 128/78, respiratory rate 16, and she was saturating 96% in room air. She is mildly obese, alert, oriented times three, pleasant in no apparent distress.  The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Sclera were anicteric. Mucous membranes were moist.  No lymphadenopathy.  The neck was supple with no carotid bruits.  The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  She had a regular rate and rhythm. The abdomen was soft, nontender, protuberant, but nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  She had no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Her pulses were palpable bilaterally.  HOSPITAL COURSE:  The plan was for a right hemicolectomy. The patient tolerated the procedure well, however, on transfer to the floor from the Post Anesthesia Care Unit, the patient was found to be unresponsive and almost apneic.  On workup, she was found to be hypercarbic which was presumed to be most likely due to narcotics from her epidural.  The epidural was immediately capped and an electrocardiogram, chest x-ray were done which were essentially within normal limits.  Once the epidural was capped, the patient's respiratory rate increased to 30 and she was saturating 91% on 50%.  She had bilateral crackles at the bases and was tachycardic.  She was brought to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit for more frequent and closer monitoring.  Her narcotics and epidural were stopped.  The patient was closely monitored and her oxygen saturations came up, however, she continued to have respiratory difficulty and, on repeat blood gases although there was some improvement, she was found to be acidotic and still hypercarbic and breathing with difficulty.  Hence, after supportive therapy was maintained for a couple of hours, the decision was made to intubate the patient and transfer to the Intensive Care Unit.  She was extubated on the following day, postoperative day two, tolerated extubation well.  She had a slight temperature of 101.7 and remained slightly tachycardic but that was her baseline and her oxygen saturations remained within normal limits in the mid to low 90s which was around her baseline.  Her temperature came down on its own.  The patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number two.  On postoperative day number three, the patient did well. However, that evening she awoke short of breath, denied any chest pain, tingling in her arms, nausea, vomiting or dizziness.  She was saturating 94% on four liters.  She did have crackles at the bases bilaterally and some rhonchi.  The decision was made to give her some Lasix in which case she quickly responded and shortness of breath dissipated. Another electrocardiogram was done which again was within normal limits.  The patient did well the following.  Vital signs were all stable.  She was saturating well.  Her nasogastric tube was taken out and she was started on sips.  She continued to do well.  On postoperative day five, she started to develop some burping and had still not passed any flatus.  Her abdomen became slightly distended.  She was kept NPO.  However, on postoperative day six, she passed large amounts of stool and decision was made to start her again on clears.  She tolerated clears well.  On postoperative day seven, she was advanced to a soft regular diet and was discharged to rehabilitation in stable condition.  Her vital signs were all stable.  She was afebrile.  A Clostridium difficile had been sent given she had multiple loose bowel movements, which is still pending. She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**].

The pain is intermittent, sharp, and electric radiating down her left lateral thigh to her left lateral calf; she has weakness in her left hip flexor.  She recently had a lumber nerve root block with immediate relief from the bupivicaine and mild improvement with the steroid injection.  A week before admission she developed worsening left sciatic pain, with significant limitation in ambulation. She was brought in by her daughter for uncontrolled pain and inability to perform activities of daily living.  She reports pain, denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of urine or stool. There is not a significant change in the quality of her radiculopathy, rather in the severity.  It is worse with sitting and standing for a prolonged time and worse when getting from a sitting to a standing position.  She states that the pain is worse when she lays on her left side as well.  The pain is slightly better with rest and lying on her right side.  The patient states that she has been able to walk with only a cane, but over the last six months, the pain has gotten so bad that at time she needs to walk with a walker and this has stopped her from going to church.

There is asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. AT LEAST moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  IMPRESSION: severe asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy; small left ventricular cavity; severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction; at least moderate (and probably significantly more) mitral regurgitation  [**9-9**] CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast:  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: A left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis is stable. The lung bases are otherwise clear. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys appear unremarkable. Note is again made of a small right renal hypodensity measuring 6 mm, likely representing a renal cyst. There is evidence of periportal edema and anasarca.  A large left retroperitoneal hematoma, now measures 8 (transverse) x 7 (AP) x 13 (coronal) cm and allowing for measurement differences, has not changed in size compared to the prior study in terms of size. No areas of active extravasation are noted on the arterial phase imaging and the density of the retroperitoneal hematoma does not increase with delayed imaging. No new hemorrhage is identified. The abdominal portions of the large and small bowel are unremarkable. Heavy calcification of the abdominal aorta is noted, and a focal area of stenosis at the level of the pancreas is additionally noted.  CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Evaluation of the pelvis is limited secondary to streak artifact from left hip prosthesis. A Foley balloon is present within the bladder. The rectum and sigmoid colon are grossly unremarkable.   IMPRESSION: Large left retroperitoneal hematoma essentially unchanged in size compared to the examination of nine hours prior. No CT evidence of active extravasation     Brief Hospital Course: ACUTE ON CHRONIC LUMBOSACRAL RADICULOPATHY: Despite multimodality pain regimen, the patient's pain remained poorly controlled, except when treated with ketorolac. Unfortunately, this is a potentially dangerous medication in this woman with advanced age, mildly reduced renal function, and on warfarin and plavix. A pain consult was obtained, but they did not add much to the present management.  MRI of LS spine showed no evidence of nerve root impingement, cauda equina or canal stenosis, but incidental note was made of a possible left pelvic mass. This was further evaluated by CT....  ...It is possible that some of the pain and weakness may be related to an iliopsoas process. . ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: related to NSAID's and dehydration . . PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Continue warfarin goal INR [**12-31**]. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Stable - plavix, statin, toprol. OSTEOPOROSIS: Vitamin D, q month Boniva HYPERTENSION: Continue outpatient medications  ____________________________________ [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course and subsequent medical service course: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of Afib, CVA, CAD initially admitted on [**9-5**] with worsening low back pain who became hypotensive to 80's systolic this evening. Of note, this morning she had a CT scan that showed an RP bleed. This was thought to be [**12-30**] increased INR and she was given 1 mg sc vitamin k and 2 mg po vitamin k. No recent procedures. No change in medications. Her coumadin was given on [**9-5**] but held since [**9-6**] because of increased INR. She also is hyponatremic which was thought to be iatrogenic from D51/2 NS maintenance fluids given continuously despite an initial sodium of 128 on admission. Her urine lytes show urine na < 10 and osm >300. Her sodium is up from 117-->121 with NS bolus. Patient herself feels well. She denies LH, dizziness, cp, palp, sob, abd pain, nausea, vomiting, back pain.  On the floor, she was given 2 u ffp, 1 u prbcs and 500 cc normal saline bolus. She initially improved with SBP high 90s to low 100s. BP recheck an hour later was in the 80s again and her crit prior to blood transfusion came back at 16 so she was transferred to the ICU for hypotension and bleed. . In the ICU, her initial vs were: T 96 BP 122/49, HR 79, O2 sat 96% RA, R 16. She reported feeling well. Denied LH, dizziness, cp, sob, abd or back pain.  [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, afib on coumadin with supratherapeutic INR presented with hypotension in setting of RP bleed and hematocrit drop.  #. RP Bleed: Seen on CT scan.  Repeat CT-scan w/ contrast did not show expansion of the hematoma or evidence of active bleed. Likely in setting of elevated INR ?????? no trauma by history. Given 2U pRBCs during admission. Hematocrit stable over rest of hospital course.  Conservative management. -*Given patient's significant retroperitoneal bleed with hct drop and hypotension, the patient's coumadin, aspirin and plavix were all discontinued. I recommend that patient not be restarted on coumadin in the future.  In my opinion, the risk of recurrent significant RP bleed outweighs the cardioembolic benefits in the setting of the patient's a-fib.  The patient can be restarted on aspirin +/- plavix per PCP discretion at future outpatient PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].*  #. Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  The patient converted from sinus rhythm to a-fib on [**9-10**] with subsequent RVR up to the 140s.  This was in the setting of RP bleed, holding of her beta-blocker, the stress of medical illness.  Cardiology was consulted to assist in management. Metoprolol was uptitrated to 75 mg po qid after which the patient eventually spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm in the early am of [**9-14**].  At time of discharge, the patient was discharged on metoprolol 100 mg po bid in sinus rhythm. -Patient will require further downtitration of her metoprolol by PCP at [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u outpatient visits.  #  HTN, benign: *Of note, the patient's amlodipine, aliskeren, and valsartan were all held at time of discharge given focus on maximizing beta-blockade for rate control.

Acute Diastolic heart failure/pulmonary edema: Occurred twice following transfusion of blood products > causing flash pulmonary edema. Pt again became SOB after blood products, improved with lasix and morphine.  Patient's also a-fib with RVR in setting of diastolic heart failure contributed.  With further gentle lasix and rate-control, the patient reached euvolemia. The patient was not discharged on lasix.  # Low back pain: No neurologic defecits on exam.

Pt was scheduled for outpatient pleuroscopy, pleurodesis, and PleurX Catheter placement today.  She was prepped and received 75Mcg of Fentanyl and 1.5 mg total of Midazolam.  An incision was made, but at that time the patient became unresponsive with bradycardia into the 30s and hypotension with SBPs in the 60s.  She required ventilatory support with a BVM briefly, got Atropine 0.5mg x 2 and the procedure was aborted (and small incision sutured closed).  She was given flumazenil 0.5mg as well as narcan 0.4mg with minimal response.  She was not responding verbally/appropriately. She was withdrawing to painful stimuli and moving all extremities.  At the time of this incident, an EKG was performed that showed atrial fibrillation and ST depressions (reportedly in V2-V3).  Repeat EKG 30 minutes later showed normalization of these abnormalities.  Prior to the procedure she reported cough, dyspnea, and weight loss. She specifically denied orthopnea, PND or leg edema.  Of note, she has had thoracentesis x  2 on [**1-26**] and [**2-27**] draining 850ml and 1300ml respectively. Post procedure her dyspnea improved and there was complete lung expansion.

CXR (portable): [**2119-4-6**] CHEST, AP: Lung volumes are low, with increased left lower lobe atelectasis and a tiny left apical pneumothorax. Right lower lobe atelectasis and subpulmonic effusion persist. Hazy opacity in the right upper lobe corresponds to known primary tumor. Left upper lobe nodule is vaguely seen overlying the second anterior and fourth posterior ribs. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and aortic tortuosity persist. The stomach is markedly distended, with PEG tube in place. IMPRESSION: 1. Bibasilar atelectasis, tiny left pneumothorax. 2. Distended stomach, please decompress through PEG tube.  CT Head w/o Contrast [**2119-4-6**]: IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial process. 2. 1.4 cm calcified left paraclinoid lesion most consistent with meningioma without associated edema. 3. Areas of hypodensity within the right parietal and right frontal regions corresponding to FLAIR abnormalities on prior MRI and consistent with remote infarcts. . MRI Head [**2119-4-7**]: No acute pathology (prelim) . CXR [**2119-4-7**] (post Pleurex): No evidence of residual pneumothorax.  Brief Hospital Course: # Altered Mental Status: The patient's unresponsiveness/altered mental status was possibly due to versed/fentanyl with slow metabolism, but also possibly due to hypoxia and resultant CNS insult that occurred as a result of her hypoperfusion with low HR and blood pressure.  Alternative explanations include CVA and other toxic/metabolic abnormalities. Glucose level was normal. As this change in level of consciousness was so acute, less likely due to infection/sepsis.  Patient also with long history of atrial fibrillation, not currently on anticoagulation with an INR of 1.2. The patient was admitted to the SICU under the care of the MICU team.  Her airway was monitored closely and she had a repeat ABG that showed 7.4/65/127.  She did not receive any further opiates/benzodiazepines.  Her mental status was waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**], and she would have periods throughout the night where she would open her eyes and follow simple commands (squeeze hands).  Otherwise, she was responsive only to painful stimuli.  An MRI of her brain was performed due to concern for embolic CVA which showed no acute pathology.  She did receive flumazenil 0.5mg again along with narcan 0.4mg.  Approximately one hour after the administration of these medicines, the patient was fully awake, alert and oriented. On the day following admission, she was able to converse with her family (present at bedside) although she frequently reported feeling ""tired.""  She later tolerated her IP procedure well and was alert on discharge.  # Hypotension: When the patient first arrived to the ICU, her blood pressures were in the high 90s and low 100s systolic. Over the subsequent several hours, her blood pressures drifted down to a nadir of 70s systolic. She received 2 IV fluid boluses of 500ml.  She showed improvement in her blood pressure to 90s-100s.  A central line set up was at bed side in case pressors were needed, but her blood pressure remained stable and then increased to 120s systolic when she became fully awake. During this time her UOP remained satisfactory, averaging 30ml/hour.  # EKG changes: The patient had EKG changes during her initial bradycardic/hypotensive episode with new RBBB and minimal ST depressions in V2-V3. A repeat EKG 30 minutes later showed resolution of these findings and only showed atrial fibrillation with no ST/T wave abnormalities. The patient does not carry the diagnosis of CAD, but is a diabetic and is predisposed to vascular abnormalities.  As a result cardiac enzymes were cycled.  A second set did show a small increase in troponin T to 0.02, but no MB component. Third set of enzymes was negative.  # NSCLC with pleural effusion: Patient is now status post 2 cycles with investigatory drug, now with reaccumulation of pleural effusion.  The reaccumulation likely represents progression of tumor. On the day following admission, she was seen by IP and a PleurX catheter was placed at bedside with drainage of 1100 cc of fluid. After the procedure, the patient reported feelling ""much better."" F/U chest x-ray showed no PTX. She was called out to the general medical wards after this procedure. She was discharged the following day with no acute issues.  # DM 2: The patient's diabetes was generally diet controlled, here with glucose range 150-250.  She was maintained on a RISS.  # Afib: Atenolol was discontinued given her hypotension. Pt's heart rate was stable prior to discharge.  # Hypothyroidism: A TSH was sent and was elevated at 7.8, however, a free T4 was normal at 1.6. Te patient was maintained on her home dose levothyroxine via PEG daily.  # Code status: The patient expressed wishes to be DNR/DNI during this admission. This decision was discussed with her daughter at bedside. The patient was provided with a DNR/DNI form to complete should she require future documentation of this decision. Patient was discharged home with VNA. The family did not want hospice but VNA will be there to assist them and help make the patient comfortable. Palliative care was also consulted this admission to help with planning.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.   Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**Known lastname 108197**], You were seen and evaluated for low blood pressure and a period of unresponsiveness in the hospital after a planned pulmonary procedure.  Your unresponsiveness was likely due to the medications you received for sedation in the procedure, and you are probably an individual who breaks down these medicines very slowly.  You were monitored closely in the intensive care unit and received fluid resuscitation for your low blood pressure. You also underwent the planned procedure, which involved placing a tube in your chest to drain the fluid. You tolerated the procedure well.  As you may be aware, you had a discussion with our palliative care team, and decided that you did not want to be recussitated. You also indicated that your goals of care were geared towards comfort, but did not want to be set up with home hospice care.  We made the following changes to your medication regimen: We stopped you blood pressure medications, including atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide, since you had low blood pressure. Should your blood pressure at home be elevated, and should you choose to treat this condition, you may contact your regular doctor to restart these medications. We also are giving you medication in case you develop constipation, i.e. loperamide, or diarrhea, i.e. colace, senna, bisacodyl; all of which may be taken on an as needed basis. Finally we are giving you morphine, to take sublingually, in case you have shortness of breath or pain.  It was a pleasure taking care of you.

She tolerated the procedure well but has been fatigued but has been experiencing abdominal pain since surgery which is poorly controlled with Percocet. She has also felt fatigued and dyspneic, consistent with prior episodes of hemolysis. Because of her abdominal pain and fatigue she has not been eating well and has not taken her cyclosporin for approximately 2 days.

On [**2154-2-26**] her WBC count was 13.4 with a hematoctit of 25.1. She underwent a CT scan of the abdomen which showed no evidence of acute bleeding or other etiology of her abdominal pain. She received 4 units of non-crossmatched PRBCs and solumedrol 125 mg IV x 1. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  On arrival to the emergency room her initial vitals were T: 98.1 BP: 118/55 HR: 97 RR: 21 O2: 99% RA. She was evaluated by the surgical service who reviewed the OSH CT scan and did not feel that there was a surgical cause of her pain. She received 6 mg IV Dilaudid for pain and 4 mg IV zofran.

Anemia: Her laboratories at OSH were consistent with but not diagnostic of hemolysis; she did not display signs of active bleeding. The haptoglobin at [**Hospital1 18**] was elevated pointing against hemolysis. Given her low hematocrit. She was initially managed in the ICU. A CT scan at [**Hospital1 18**] showed extensive clot burden in her portal system, likely related to her prior surgery. She received four units of major antibody crossmatched blood, and additional tubes were sent to the Red Cross for further crossmatching.  Hematology saw the patient in the emergency room, and recommended treatment with steroids and cyclosporine. She was started on Solumedrol 80mg IV daily and Cyclosporine 150mg PO q12hours. Hemolysis labs were monitored as well as Cyclosporine levels. The Surgical team also followed the patient in the ICU. After transfer to the medical floor, Hct gradually rose daily to 36.6 at time of discharge. Solumedrol was tapered and converted to prednisione. Cyclosporine was also tapered to 75mg [**Hospital1 **]. LDH was persistently elevated likely secondary to abdominal clot process. F/u was scheduled with her hemtologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**].  Abdominal Pain/Portal thrombus: The pain was diffuse, severe, and out of proportion to exam. CT scan of abdomen did show large portal clot burden. Empiric metronidazole was started until a C.diff could be obtained, but as pt did not have a BM, it was continued until day of discharge. Her pain was controlled with Dilaudid as needed.  Her diet was advanced to regular, but on the day of discharge (against medical advice), she did not tolerate jello without IV dilaudid.  Plan was for pt to remain until able to tolerate clears with only po pain meds, but she chose to leave AMA (form signed). She has f/u scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within one week. Expressed understanding of need to return if abdominal pain increases. Given 5 days worth of home dose of percocet.  Thrombocytosis:  Likely related to recent splenectomy, improved from 1.5 million to 900K at time of d/c.  Leukocytosis: Likely reactive process + related to high dose steroids. No fevers.  No localizing sources of infection with the exception of abdominal pain. She was started on empiric Flagyl which was discontinued at time of discharge. White count peaked at 36 and fell to 17.5 at time of discharge.  Acute Kidney Injury:  Creatinine 1.3 from baseline < 1.0. The was felt to most likely be prerenal from dehydration. This returned to baseline prior to d/c. . Hypertension: likely secondary to steroids and cyclosporine. not stating anti-htn at this time, continue to monitor; should improve with taper. BPs peaking in the 170/80 range at time of discharge. . Anxiety: The patient was noted to be very anxious, and this seemed to worsen after the initiation of steroids. There is concern that the steroid is causing side effects, including psychosis, as it had done in the past according to the patient. She was continued on home benzodiazepines (Klonopin), as well as Haldol PRN. Disscharged on home klonopin dose.  ***PT DISCHARGED AMA.  Our recommendation was that she stay until being able to tolerate po with only percocet for pain control. She signed AMA form and expressed understanding of risks.

Is not tolerating solid food without IV dilaudid at the time of discharge.   Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with severe abdominal pain and a very low blood count. You received a blood transfusion at an outside hospital and another one here.  At the time of discharge, your blood counts were nearing the normal range.  A scan of your abdomen showed a large amount of blood clots in the vessels that drain your intestines.  For this, you will need to be anticoagulated for some time.  You are being discharged against medical advice.  We strongly advise you to stay until you were able to tolerate food without IV pain medication.  There is a risk that advancing your diet without medical supervision may lead to an acute abdomen process requiring urgent intervention.  Please return to the hospital if you develop: severe abdominal pain, fevers, chills, sweats, dizziness, blood in your stool, tarry stools, any other form of bleeding, severe headache, chenage in vision, or any other symptom which seriously concerns you.  Several changes were made to your medications: - cyclosporin has been reduced to 75mg twice daily - prednisone 30mg daily has been started - warfarin 5mg daily has been started - bactrim (single strength) has been started - omeprazole, paroxeteine, clonazepam, calcium/vitamin D, and folic acid have been continued at previous doses.  Followup Instructions: We have scheduled you an appointment with [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 2359**] Date/Time:[**2154-3-14**] at 11:45am  Please call Dr.[**Name (NI) 7750**] office today and make an appointment for Tuesday [**3-12**].

Briefly, he had a mechanical fall on [**2134-8-12**] and subsequently sustained a SAH, transverse process fracture at L2/L3, a compression fracture of T3/T12/L1/L4, and a left acetabular fracture. His SAH and fractures were thought to be non-operable per neurosurgery and ortho, respectively. His course in the TICU was also remarkable for respiratory distress and ?new hypoxia on the day after admission (he was 98%2L on the day of admission per review of the notes), for which he was placed on a face mask, started on solumedrol, nebs, and azithromycin empirically for a presumed COPD exacerbation. This was weaned down to 2L NC on the day prior to transfer and he was satting 98%ra on the morning of transfer with a plan to go to rehab today. . Per report, later this morning around 11 a.m., he was found to be dyspneic, lethargic and breathing at a rate of 40. He was placed on a nonrebreather and had O2 satts in the 70s, HR 100s (afib), SBP 110. ABG was 7.37/47/98/28. He was thought to have aspirated vs flash pulmonary edema and given lasix 40 mg IV x 1 with good UOP. Of note, his family has been updated and he agrees to BiPAP but would want to be comfortable if this fails (after many conversations with patient and family). .

Orthopaedics and Neurosurgery were consulted for these injuries.  Orthopaedics recommended non-operative management of L hip fracture. Patient was to be touch-down weight-bearing for 6 weeks and to follow-up in the [**Hospital 13308**] clinic after this course of time.  Neurosurgery recommended normalization of his INR and repeat imaging of his head in 6hours and 24 hours.  No intervention was recommended for vertebral fractures.  His repeat head CTs revealed no change.  Patient had unstable respiratory status while in the ICU, which was felt to be d/t COPD flair.  He was treated with steroids, CPAP or BiPAP, and Azithromycin.   He experienced some delirium and sundowning in the unit and geriatrics was consulted and recommended afternoon haldol rather than standing doses and tylenol with breakthrough oxycodone rather than morphine standing.  On HD4 patient had discussion with team regaring desire to be DNR/DNI and desire for care not to be escalated.  Patient was weaned to 2L NC and transferred to floor.  Physical therapy and occupational therapy evaluated the patient and hospice care was consulted.  Patient had a speech and swallow consult.  1:1 supervision with crushed/pureed foods was recommended.  On HD5 patient became increasingly tachypneic and was transferred back to the T/SICU for BiPAP.  The decision was made to transfer patient from surgical intensive care unit to medical intensive care unit.  During his MICU stay, the patient was placed on Bipap for hypoxic respiratory failure.  He was placed empirically on antibiotics and was given IV steroids for a possible COPD exacerbation.  He remained dyspneic with labored work of breathing while on Bipap. LENIs were performed, which showed a new DVT in his lower extremity.  He was thus placed on a heparin drip.  He went into AFib with RVR and was started on a diltiazem drip.  He developed increased work of breathing in the setting of AFib with RVR and eventually expired from cardiopulmonary arrest.

The patient was at that time apparently at her baseline and cleared for surgery. The patient underwent penetrating keratoplasty on [**2119-3-30**] for indication of failed graft without complication. The patient was seen by her ophthalmologist on [**2119-4-4**] with impression that there was moderate lid edema present suggestive of hypersensitivity but no discharge to suggest infection. Polysporin was discontinued (with concern for hypersensitivty per discussion with daughter) and other meds (Pred 1% TID OS, Timolol 0.5% [**Hospital1 **] OU, Xalatan QHS OS, Tobradex [**Doctor Last Name **] OS QHS) continued. The patient now presents form her [**Hospital3 **] with concern for altered mental status. Only limited information is available from available staff at [**Hospital3 400**], with report only that patient was noted tonight to be acutely confused and ""not making sense"". Per discussion with the patient's daughter, the patient was in her usual state of health as early as yesterday morning, looking well. Later in the day, the patient was reported to be walking up and down the hallway, refusing to go to her room. The patient was noted to be shivering and unsteady on her feet. Recommendation was made that patient be sent to hospital for further evaluation. Per discussion with daughter, the patient has had prior episodes of confusion in setting of underlying infetion, usually UTI. . ED Course: 98.4 -> 102.8 rectal, 186/84, 85, 20, 93% RA. Labs notable for WBC 8.0, lactate 1.8. Not signed out, but per nursing report and discussion a central line was attempted given poor PIV access for which the patient received Haldol. No documentation of dose is available, [**Name8 (MD) **] RN to RN signout this was 5mg IV. Central line was not successfully placed and ultimately a 22 PIV in the hand was obtained. The patient had a negative UA, CXR without obvious infiltrate although limited. Ophthalmology was not contact[**Name (NI) **] as [**Name (NI) **] impression was that eye was not infected. LP was recommended by ED but patients' daughter declined this. The patient was given Azithromycin, Vancomycin, and Ceftriaxone empirically and is now admitted to the medical service for ongoing care. On arrival to floor patient is lethargic but wakes to voice. She answers questions although requires repeat questioning at times to wake her. Patient reports mild neck pain since having collar removed, denies headache, chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain or other localizing symptoms.

No acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute fracture. 2. Diffuse cerebral atrophy with moderate sulcal and ventricular prominence. 3. Chronic microvascular infarcts, unchanged. 4. Paranasal sinus disease as described, likely acute in the sphenoid sinus.  CT neck [**4-6**]: 1. Significant swelling/inflammation of the soft tissues at the base of tongue, oropharynx, with fullness in the vallecula and the piriform sinuses, overall resulting in moderate to marked narrowing of the oropharynx. The etiology of this finding is uncertain from the present study. To correlate with direct ENT examination. 2. Fullness of the hypopharynx and adjacent portions of esophagus - no adequately assessed on the present study- further evaluation recommended. 3. Increased attenuation of the fat in the carotid space, with soft tissue attenuation opacity, with heterogeneous appearance, causing indentation on the right internal jugular vein extending down along the carotid space, into the region of the thoracic inlet. This may relate to inflammation, phlegmon, and radiation-related changes if there is history of radiation in the past and less likely neoplastic. Close followup evaluation, with ultrasound can be considered to evaluate for any abscess, given the patient's symptoms of fever.  CT orbits: 1. Increased attenuation of the preseptal soft tissues with some enhancement, on the left side, likely due to inflamamtion/ post-surgical changes- correlate with clinical examination. No definite abscess on the present set of images. No intraconal abnormality. F/u as clinically indicated. 2. Moderate paranasal sinus disease  CT head [**4-9**]: 1. No acute intracranial process. 2. Persistent cerebral atrophy. 3. Chronic microvascular ischemic changes. 4. Paranasal sinus disease.  MRI/MRA brain: Final Report HISTORY: Parkinson's, delirium, lethargy, right facial droop and dysarthria. Evaluate for signs of intracranial hemorrhage or acute stroke.  Comparison is made to most recent head CT of [**2119-4-9**]  TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted sequences were obtained through the brain without intravenous gadolinium. 3D time-of-flight MR arteriography was also performed. Volume-rendering reconstructed images were evaluated.  MRI OF THE BRAIN AND MRA OF THE BRAIN: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, masses, mass effect, or regions of restricted diffusion to suggest acute infarction. A few scattered periventricular T2/FLAIR hyperintensities are noted, which are nonspecific but likely suggest chronic small vessel ischemia. There are also adjacent prominent Virchow-[**Doctor First Name **] spaces. While there is underlying global cerebral atrophy, the degree of dilatation of the ventricular system may be somewhat disproportionate to the amount of central atrophy. Small amount of fluid is noted in the mastoids bilateral.  MR arteriography of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] displays no aneurysmal dilatation. Mild atherosclerosis is noted in the right M1 segment. Posterior circulation is left dominant.  IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of acute infarction. Scattered changes likely related to chronic small vessel ischemic disease.  2. Question slightly disproportionate degree of ventricular dilatation in relation to the amount underlying cerebral atrophy. While this finding is nonspecific, in the appropriate clinical scenario it may reflect underlying NPH.    Brief Hospital Course: This pt is a 88yo female w h/o Parkinson's disease, mild dementia and recent corneal transplant admitted to the hospital for AMS and to the ICU for airway narrowing. . # Airway narrowing: She was noted to have swelling of the tongue and lower lips on admission. A CT of the Head and Neck with IV contrast showed no clear evidence of preseptal cellulitis and ? of soft tissue infection/edema of neck and throat. Over course of day, noted to have increased audible upper airway sounds with good O2 sat of 97% on 2L which has been stable. ENT was consulted and saw extensive edema and soft tissue swelling in oropharynx with patent airway. Swelling around false cords, tonsillar edema, but true cords without edema. The team thought the swelling to be secondary to possible allergic reaction to medications. She was started on solumedrol 60IV and famotidine 20mg. She was given one dose of zosyn and then switched to unasyn to cover for possible soft tissue infection. Pt without leukocytosis, fever (was 102.8 in the ED but afebrile since), or abcess. ENT and anesthesia recommended transfer to ICU for further monitoring. She was monitored and continued on Decadron for three doses. During successive scopes by ENT, oropharyngeal edema and some secretions were seen, but airway remained patent. Unclear etiology: possible allergic reaction vs infectious process vs both given tonsils appear possibly infectious and lower airway appears more edematous and less infectious. Lisinopril was stopped, and her laryngoscopic exam visibly improved by the time she was called out to the floor. -Pt was treated for 10 days for ?soft tissue infection and switched to Augmentin for additional 5 days at dc -ENT follow up appt was set up  # s/p corneal TP: lid edema on exam. Ophtho believes likely secondary to blockage of drainage and not as likely due to allergy.  Ophtho felt the eye was improving and recommended decreasing doses of eye drops. -FU appt with Optho set up . #. Altered Mental Status: On admission, she was lethargic, possibly from the Haldol she received in the ED. By the time she was called out of the ICU, she was likely at her baseline mental status, pleasant and easily conversant. Shortely thereafter, however, she became agitated and combative and received 1.5mg Haldol and later the same day 5mg of Zyprexa. She remained agitated for about 36 hours before she became lethargic and barely arousable. Head CT was unchanged from before. She had not had any new fevers or new signs of infection. She had a lumbar puncture that was unremarkable. MRI/MRA was neg except for some ventriculomegaly in setting of global atrophy which was difficult to differentiate from NPH. Neurology thought it was unlikely to be NPH. EEG showed some focal acitivity concerning for sublinical seizures. Pt was started on keppra, initially continued to have periods of somnolence along with R sided facial droop (which was thought be Neurology to represent a post-ictal state with [**Doctor Last Name 555**] paralysis) but day before discharge had significant improvement in mental status and was alert and conversive. Due to hx of dementia and also ongoing hypoactive delirium, pt was not fully oriented but did have significant improvement in level of alertness. -Pt curently is on Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] for one week and to be increased to 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] later and kept at that dose. -Pt should be followed by a neurologist at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab -Outpt FU w neurology is already set up .  #. UTI: grew Enterococcus in UCx. She was continued on Unasyn for 10 days. . #. Positive blood cultures: 1/4 bottles growing coag negative Staph. This was likely a contaminant so vancomycin was stopped. Repeat blood cultures were negative.  #. Parkinson's Disease: continued Sinemet except when patient was too lethargic to safely take meds . #. Hypertension, benign: Lisinopril was stopped due to concern of angioedema. Atenolol was continued. . #. Hyperlipidemia: continued statin . #. Hypothyroidism:  TSH normal on [**2119-4-6**] so not a picture of myxedema and cannot account for MS change. Continued levothyroxine.  #. Diabetes II, diet controlled without complication: - insulin sliding scale while inpatient  and bs were wnl.

The pain is worst when she tried to bear weight on the leg, or when she uses it to roll over or adjust her position in bed.  The pain begins in her buttock and travels down the posterior thigh and calf but stops before reaching the ankle.  It occasionally feels like it is coming from her low back.  She denies any parasthesias or weakness in the leg, and she denies any numbness in her foot or groin.  She denies any fevers or incontinence. The pain was unrelieved by Vicodin that she had at home, so she scheduled an urgent visit with her nephrologist yesterday [**2141-9-4**].  At her nephrologist??????s office, she was hypertensive to 250/145 and so she was referred to the ED.  She ended up leaving the ED against medical advice yesterday, but returned today because of persistent leg pain.  She reports that she took all of her morning and noon BP meds.    She denies any fevers, headaches, visual changes, nausea (prior to coming to the ED), or leg weakness.    Upon arrival to the ED today, she was afebrile, BP 237/146, HR 97, RR 16, Sat 100% on room air.  She received a total of 90 mg of IV labetalol and nitropaste, and was eventually put on a labetalol drip for her hypertension.  With these interventions, her SBP dropped to the 180s, but she reported feeling nauseous and so the drip was discontinued.  She was also given 4 mg of IV morphine and 1 mg of IV hydromorphone for her leg pain with decent relief.  Due to a urinalysis suggestive of infection, she was given one tablet of DS TMP/SMX.

Interval resolution of pulmonary edema.   Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 24 year old woman with SLE, CKD V, and multiple admissions for labile hypertension who presented to the ED complaining of about a weeks?????? worth of right leg pain. She was initially admitted to the MICU for hypertensive urgency and then transfered to the floor after a day.  # Hypertensive urgency: had been on labetalol drip in the ED, but this was stopped due to nausea (presumed that her BP was coming down too fast).  She was started on her home meds and tolerated these fairly well.  Transferred to the floor and noted to have SPBs in the 90s.  She required 1L IVF bolus since her baseline SBP is thought to run in the 130-170 range.  She also had transient dizziness during this episode.  BP meds were held and later that night her SBP was in the 220s.  BP meds restarted.  She remained stable thereafter with SBPs in the 130-170s.  We opted to discharge her on her home regimen (without decreasing doses) since she is more often having issues with elevated blood pressures. . # Right leg pain: no evidence of avascular necrosis or fracture on plain film. MRI and plain films were ordered and showed no acute pathology.  The pain was in the distribution of her right hamstring and was worsened when it was stretched thus suggesting a muscle injury.  CK was normal.  Pain was treated with dilaudid initially.  On day of discharge, she was able to ambulate without gait abnormality or pain.  PT saw her and rec outpt PT followup. . # CKD V: PD catheter placement in place. Pt was tried on PD on a number of occasions but did not tolerate it [**2-11**] pain.  KUB confirmed tip in place.  Cx of peritoneal fluid not suggestive of peritonitis.  K remained mildly elevated.  Hyperpara treated with sevelamer (although patient refused) then tums.

Discharge Instructions: You came in with right leg pain and poorly controlled hypertension.  Your blood pressure was controlled initially with IV medications then your home medications.  Since your blood pressure was occasionally low, we recommend that you hold your labetalol if you are feeling lightheaded or have dizziness or have blood pressure less than 110/60.  In terms of your leg pain, we performed xrays, ultrasound, and MRI without finding a cause.  We suspect a hamstring injury given its location.  Please take pain medications if needed.  We recommend followup with physical therapy.  You also had a fever which is suggestive of infection.  We treated you with cipro in case you had a UTI.  Otherwise, your cultures were unrevealing.  We attempted peritoneal dialysis but this was unsuccessful. Please followup with your nephrologist.  Please return to the ED if you experience headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, high fevers, or worsening leg pain.  Please hold your coumadin for two days then restart as per previously written.  Please take lactulose for constipation.

Surgeons used fluroscopy to check for endoleaks rather than request TEE.  Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2116-11-9**] and underwent endovascular repair of her thoracic aortic aneurysm. Pt tolerated the procedure well. For full detail please see operative reports. Pt went to the ICU post-operatively and remained intubated due to low tidal volumes. Pt remained on a fentanyl drip for pain control and was placed on an insulin sliding scale for tight glycemic control post-operatively. Pt was extubated the morning of POD1 on [**11-10**]. Pt was weaned on nitroglycerin drip. On [**11-11**] diet was begun and advanced to clears the lumbar drain was removed. The pt was transferred from the ICU to the VICU stepdown unit, the PA catheter and arterial line were removed. BP was controlled with lopressor. Pt began to work with physical therapy on [**11-12**]. BP management was transitioned to her home medications of amlodipine, Atenolol, and enalapril. Home medications were restarted. Noted on telemetry, pt had several asymptomatic episodes of bradycardia. The cardiology service was consulted who recommended changing her blood pressure management to Losartan and discontinuing her previous home medications. There were no further bradycardic events after this change was made and her pressures were well controlled. On [**11-13**] physical therapy continued as pt was still quite unsteady. Pt was discharged home on [**11-14**] with home physical therapy, tolertating a regular diet.

A faint right lower lobe opacity may be due to bronchovascular crowding, however an early developing pneumonia can not be excluded.  RUQ U/S [**6-6**] IMPRESSION: Patient is status post cholecystectomy. Study is otherwise unremarkable.  CTA CHEST [**6-7**] IMPRESSION: 1. Very small subsegmental left apical pulmonary emboli, unlikely to account for the patient's severe hypotensive episode. 2. Bibasilar pleural effusions, right greater than left, with associated airspace disease, atelectasis versus aspiration or pneumonia. 3. Cardiomegaly and dense coronary artery calcifications.  LENI [**6-7**] IMPRESSION: Limited exam due to patient agitation and motion. No definite evidence of right lower extremity DVT. Please note that left lower extremity venous ultrasound was not performed due to patient incooperation.  CT HEAD [**6-8**] IMPRESSION: No change in subacute to chronic infarctions at the right occipital and parietal lobes. No new evidence of acute ischemia or acute hemorrhage is seen.  ECHO [**6-8**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with global hypokinesis and inferior and apical akinesis (LVEF= 20 %). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-4-7**], the degree of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are probabaly similar (underestimated on prior report). The LVEF is similar. The degree of pulmonary hypertension detected has increased.  EEG [**6-9**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG in the waking and sleeping states due to the disorganized, low voltage, and slow background with admixed bursts of moderate amplitude generalized mixed frequency  slowing. This constellation of findings is consistent with a mild global encephalopathy due to dysfunction of bilateral subcortical or deep midline structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, infection and anoxia are among the common causes of encephalopathy but there are others. There were no areas of prominent focal slowing. There were no epileptiform features.  Brief Hospital Course: 69 y.o. F h/o CAD s/p multiple stents, ischemic CM EF 25%, asthma, multiple recent admissions (most recently [**Date range (1) 27916**] to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for fall and hypoglycemia thought [**2-21**] insulin use in the setting of ARF; previously [**Date range (1) 107613**] c respiratory failure thought [**2-21**] COPD and CHF. found by her VNA to hypoxic to 80's on RA.  Upon arrival to the ED VS= 86% on ra, HR 100, BP 155/59, RR 32.  She was treated for COPD flare (steroids), CHF (bipap, lasix, nitro gtt), and PNA (levaquin).  CTA not performed [**2-21**] inability to lie flat, but pt empirically started on heparin gtt.  Her oxygen status improved and she was transferred to the MICU.  In the MICU, pt's antibiotic coverage was broadened to CTX/vanco and azithromycin.  In the setting of her first azithromycin dose on [**6-6**], pt became hypotensive requiring pressors (levo, neo, vaso), felt to be an allergic reaction to the azithromycin. Pressors were titrated off ~12 hrs later on [**6-7**].  Her respiratory status continued to improve, and she was weaned of bipap on [**6-7**], and steroids were discontinued as COPD was felt less likely.  On [**6-7**] pt's HCT 31->24, she was transfused 1U PRBC, complicated by grand mal seizure, and hypotension, again requiring pressors (levo, neo, vaso) for ~12hrs.  Neuro was consulted as there was also a question of left dilated pupil, head CT showed no acute bleeding, +subacute/chronic infarctions, EEG c/w toxic/metabolic insult, heparin gtt was held.  CTA was obtained which showed very small left apical PE, felt unlikely to account for hypotension.  TTE revealed EF=20% (old), 2+mr, 3+tr.  On [**6-9**], repeat blood transfusion performed without complication.  HCT 21->26, however hemolysis labs revealed hapto<20, LDH 760->468, smear +schistocytes, suggestive of hemolysis, DAT negative x 2 ([**6-8**], [**6-9**]).  Per report, pt's mental status (which waxes and wanes), is not far from her baseline.  She responds to voice, but is a&ox1 (name) only.  On [**6-10**] O2 and BP were stable and pt was transferred to the floor.  On the Floor she completed her course of Vanc/Cefepime. Her BP stabilized and she was restarted on home antihypertensive regimen.  Fingersticks remained elevated, and her glargine was increased for better glycemic control.  She continued on albuterol and atrovent prn for shortness of breath/wheezing. Heme/onc was consulted regarding hemolysis and anticoagulation. Their recommendations stated that the exact cause of hemolysis is difficult to interpret, however by the time the pt was on the floor, the hct was rising and LDH was falling suggesting that hemolysis was resolving.  They recommended that there was no contraindication to anticoagulation.  Given her multiple indications for anticoagulation, decision was made to begin coumadin with a lovenox bridge. Her INR was 1.9 on discharge, and she will continue on lovenox SQ until INR therapeutic at 2-3 and coumadin 10 mg daily.  The lovenox may be stopped after therapeutic INR.  INRs should be followed and her dose adjusted accordingly.  Medications on Admission: 1. Clopidogrel 75 mg daily 2. Atorvastatin 20 mg daily 3. Paroxetine HCl 20 mg daily 4. Albuterol INH PRN 5.

She was evaluated as an outpatient intially by dermatology that did a biopsy of the scalp mass and she was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma. The ulcerative lesion eroding skull extending intracranially and was to have neurosurgical intervention but the patient was supertheraputic INR of 7.7 so she was sent to the MICU. She was reversed with reversed with 10 IV K, 2u FFP. She was also noted to have arf with cr of 2, anuric, dry on exam with a sodium 158-->161. She received a NS bolus and then D5W and avoiding lasix and acei given renal failure, renal ultrasound with R hydro and pelvic mass (family does not want w/u). Patient was placed on vanc and cetriaxone for meningitis proprolaxis since there is CSF communicating with skin secondary to scc. Patient is having PICC placed in the AM for long-term abx and fluids.

No reconstructions were available. No formal report was provided.  FINDINGS:  Within the brain parenchyma, there is global parenchymal atrophy, indicated by enlargement of the ventricles and sulci. There is also periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity, consistent with small vessel ischemic disease. A right cerebellar lacunar infarct is also noted. There is no hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect. There is no shift of normally midline structures. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation appears preserved.  There is a large destructive lesion involving the vertex of the calvarium. There is no underlying brain mass lesion or brain abscess, although there is an extra- axial, likely subdural, soft tissue/fluid component to this lesion, although this is difficult to evaluate due to volume averaging at the vertex and the lack of reconstructions. The lesion at the vertex causes significant osseous destruction. There is subcutaneous gas, which also extends intracranially, with resultant pneumocephalus.  IMPRESSION: 1. Extensive destructive lesion involving the calvarial vertex, with intracranial extension indicated by pneumocephalus and extra-axial, intracranial soft tissue/fluid component. This does not appear to be of primary CNS etiology. Differential includes infectious process or a subcutaneous or osseous malignancy. Further evaluation with contrast-enhanced MRI is recommended.  2. Small vessel ischemic disease, lacunar infarcts, and global parenchymal atrophy. There are no brain mass lesions or brain abscesses identified.  Renal ultrasound [**2163-6-7**]: FINDINGS: The left kidney measures 9 cm in length. There is no left-sided hydronephrosis. The right kidney measures 9.5 cm in length. There is moderate right-sided hydronephrosis. There is no renal mass or stone. There is a large > 15 cm cystic pelvic mass, which cannot be further characterized. Bladder is not visualized.  IMPRESSION: 1. Moderate right-sided hydronephrosis. 2. Non-specific, large cystic pelvic mass.   Brief Hospital Course: Patient was a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with h.o CHF, DM, afib, who presented with invasive scalp squamous cell carcinoma with intracranial extension who died after code status was CMO. . # CMO - Had family meeting [**6-10**]. Discussed to stop vital signs, non-essential medications other than eye drops, pain meds, and PO antibiotics. Patient was continued on maintainance IV fluids. . # Pain control - This was the family's primary goal of care. There were multiple etiologies of the pain including her chonic right shoulder pain, sacral decubiti with possible abcess, painful scalp leison, or the >15cm pelvic mass. Pain control was transitioned from outpatient oxycontin pills to fenanyl patch and oxycodone liquid. Patient was comfortably sedated and only required additional pain medication when she was moved. Palliative care was involved in pain management. . # Squamous cell ca, intracranial- The carcinoma developed over an unknown time period. It probably developed before her care to nursing home facility given that there was a rapid decline in her functional status and intracraninal involvement of the tumor.  She was evaluated as an outpatient by dermatology and was determined to have a squamous cell ca as per biopsy on [**5-25**]. Initially, the family wanted to have a neurosurgical intervention, but the patient's INR was 7.7 so she was transferred to the MICU for reversal. Later, the family decided not to have surgery once it became apparent that the morbity was high. Patient was started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone for meningitis ppx and this was changed to PO cefepoxidime after a family meeting determining that she would not want IV antibiotics. Wound care was done to address her head wound. . # Resolved hypovolemia/ acute renal failure/ hypernatremia - secondary to dehydration and intravascular hypovolemia in the setting of diruetic use. Cr 2.0 on admission, most recent baseline at [**Hospital1 18**] 1.1. This was the reason for the PICC line placement and why the family wanted IVF. . # Pelvic mass - There is a large > 15 cm cystic pelvic mass seen on renal ultrasound. This may be a source of pain. . # afib not on anticoagulation - Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation but was placed on anticoagulation for a recent phelbiltis. Given that the scalp wound oozes blood, the family has decided that they do not want anticoagulation. . # DM-HISS .

No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Slightly dense appearance of the cortex lateral to the Sylvian fissure ( se 2, im 12) is likely related to volume averaging rather than hemorrhage; a follow up can be considered if necessary.

Small left adrenal adenoma. 5. Unchanged Focal celiac artery and aortic dilation as described above. . Colonoscopy: ============ [**3-1**] Colonoscopy prior to this admission: Abnormal mucosa in the colon. Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. A small posterior rectal fissure was noted in the anal canal. This was not bleeding. Blood was noted throughout the entire colon. Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum. . [**2195-4-3**] colonoscopy: Non bleediong diverticulosis of the whole colon. Bleeding angioectasias in the cecum treated with APC. Polyp in the transverse colon. Blood and stool throughout colon. Non bleeding posterior anal fissure. . [**2195-4-13**] colonoscopy: Blood in the whole colon. Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and descending colon. Ulcers in the cecum. A large adherent blood clot was found in the cecum with surrounding oozing of bright red blood. Given the risk of uncontrollable bleeding in the setting of low platelets, the clot was not removed. Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 73078**] is 79 year old pleasant woman with a Past medical history significant for MDS with AML transformation on Dacogen, diverticulosis, known cecal AVMs admitted from clinic on [**2195-4-1**] in the setting of a transfusion reaction to platelets with thrombocytopenia who was noted to develop bright red blood per rectum with acute hematocrit drop who underwent repeat colonoscopy showing non-bleeding diverticulosis of the entire colon and bleeding angioectasias of the cecum treated with Argon Plasma coagulation. She required a second colonoscopy for repeated bloody bowel movements which showed a clot adherent to the cecum. She remained stable for a while then had frequent bloody bowel movements again which was controlled by amicar drip for 8 hours. Gradually her platelets started to increase. After these events, she remained stable and was discharged home in stable condition. She will require HLA matched platelet transfusions in the future if needed. . # cecal AVMs:  She was transferred to the ICU twice for bright red blood per rectum. The patient developed BRBPR, and was found to have cecal AVMs on colonoscopy s/p APC. Specifically, repeat colonoscopy demonstrated cecal angioectasias that were actively bleeding, non-bleeding colonic diverticula and small polyp. Hemostasis achieved with Argon Plasma coagulation therapy on [**2195-4-3**].  During her stay she required several units of PRBC and platelets. After remaining stable, she was transferred back to the floor however she had the same situation again and was transferred back to the ICU where she had her second colonoscopy which showed a clot adherent to the cecum with oozing around the clot. The clot was not removed (not amenable to endoscopic management). GI recommended surgical consult for possible resection however given her underlying disease and low platelet counts, they felt this will not be a favorable management. After having stable H/H, she was transferred back to the floor. While on the floor, she had a few bloody bowel movements however the night of [**4-17**] she had total of 450 cc bloody watery stools which required amicar drip for 8 hours (her platelets were in the 40-50's). CTA was negative. Following this, she did not have any further significant bloody stools. She remained vitally stable with stable H/H and gradually rising platelet count. . # thrombocytopenia: Secondary to chemotherapy and MDS/AML concerns. Concern for consumptive process following transfusion of platelets in the setting of possible ITP vs. TTP however Hematologic smear was without schistocytes and there was no evidence of renal failure or neurologic concerns; no fevers. The patient also had two transfusion reactions to platelets when first admitted. She was premedicated with anti-histamines. While the patient was actively bleeding, she was also given Amicar (2 grams IV with 1gram/hour IV infusion overnight on [**2195-4-2**]). This was repeated over the night of [**4-17**] as above. She was found to have a positive PRA and required HLA matched platelets for all subsequent transfusions. Her twin sister was tested at Red Cross for potential candidate to donate platelets for her sister however since she takes aspirin and plavix, this was not a suitable option. Of note, her platelet count was improving already and did not require further platelet transfusions. Platelet count was in the 90's upon discharge. . # transfusion reaction/PRA positive: The patient had transfusion reaction to platelet transfusion (once in clinic, and once while on the floor). She was premedicated with famotidine, benadryl, and hydrocortisone. A blood bank work up was initiated, and the patient was given group specific platelets. She was found to be PRA positive and requires HLA matched platelets. However, during her second episode of BRBPR on [**4-12**], it was found that there was no more HLA matched platelets available in [**Location (un) 86**] area. Red Cross was contact[**Name (NI) **] for more HLA matched platelets. Sister was a potential donor however it wasn't suitable given her anti-platelet therapy as above. She did not require further platelet transfusions once her platelet count started to increase. . # MDS with AML transformation:  While the patient was on the floor, it was noticed that her blast count was trending up and her neutrophil count was trending down.  It was then decided to start her on second cycle of Dacogen (day 1 = [**2195-4-8**]).  The patient tolerated the Dacogen well, with little side effects. 12% blast cells on peripheral blood upon discharge. . # GERD: The patient was continued on her home PPI. . # constipation:  The patient has a history of severe constipation, however, her home medications were held in the setting of her BRBPR and then restarted upon discharge given resolution of bloody bowel movements. . Transitional Issues: - The patient had transfusion reaction to platelets; a blood bank work up was initiated and she was found to be PRA positive; she will require HLA matched platelets for all subsequent transfusions.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.   Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 73078**],  It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**].  You were admitted to the hospital because you had a transfusion reaction after getting platelets at clinic.  We did some tests and found that you will need specially screened platelets from now on because your body reacts to normal platelets.  While you were here, you also developed some bleeding from your rectum.  You were transferred to the intensive care unit and they gastrointestinal doctors looked into your intestines with a camera and found some areas of bleeding called AV malformations that were clipped. After this, you were sent to the floor then sent back to the ICU when you had further bleeding. Second colonoscopy was done which showed a large clot attached to your colon in the same area where the AVM's were clipped. Your blood level was stable as well as your blood pressure and you were transferred to the floor.  While on the floor, you had a few loose bloody stools that subsequently resolved. Your diet was gradually advanced and you tolerated it well prior to discharge. Your platelets gradually increased and it was in the 80's on your discharge day.  The surgeons evaluated you for possible surgical removal of part of your colon, however they felt it is unsafe to do surgery for the moment. We did not discharge you on Amicar which is a clot stabilizer medication since you did not have further bloody stools, your blood level was stable and your platelets were gradually increasing.  We also noticed some changes in your blood work that made us think that your leukemia was acting up again; because of that we started you on another five day cycle of chemotherapy.  You tolerated the chemo well. . While in the hosiptal, it was noted that occasionally your blood pressure was high and you were started on a medication for brief time. However, given your GI bleeds, this was held. We will not discharge you at the moment with anti-hypertensive medication.  We did the following changes in your medication list: - Please stop allopurinol  Please continue the rest of your home medications the same way you were taking them at home prior to admission.  Your PICC line was removed prior to discharge.  It will be important for you to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Please follow with your appointments as illustrated below.

TECHNIQUE: CT of the C-spine without IV contrast.  COMPARISON: MR of the C-spine available from [**2191-6-5**].  FINDINGS: There are no acute fractures or traumatic malalignment. There is mild straightening of lordosis, consistent with the presence of cervical collar. There are moderate to severe degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine, including severe facet arthropathy, and loss of intervertebral disc space, most severely at C5 through T1. There is grade 1 anterolisthesis of C4 over C5. Diffuse disc bulging is present at C5-C6 and C6-C7, resulting in moderate spinal canal stenosis, most severely at C5-C6.  There is no prevertebral hematoma or adjacent soft tissue abnormalities. Included views of the lungs demonstrate mild dependent atelectasis bilaterally. There are multiple nodules within the slightly enlarged right thyroid lobe.  IMPRESSION: 1. No acute fractures or traumatic malalignment. 2. Moderate-to-severe degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine, most severely at C5-C6, with associated moderate spinal canal stenosis. 3. Multiple right thyroid nodules.  The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Final Report INDICATION: 86-year-old female status post fall and acute mental status changes.  TECHNIQUE: CT of the head without IV contrast.  COMPARISON: CT of the head available from [**2193-12-12**].  FINDINGS: There is a large left cerebral subdural hematoma, measuring up to 17 mm in thickness, with blood tracking along the left tentorium. There is significant neighboring mass effect on left cerebral sulci and the left lateral ventricle with subfalcine herniation and 17-mm rightward shift of normally midline structures. The hematoma has mixed hyper and hypoattenuating components, consistent with an acute on chronic bleeding. There is slight effacement of the suprasellar cistern, concerning for an early rightward uncal herniation. Slight hyperattenuation along the suprasellar cistern borders may represent trace subarachnoid blood. The quadrigeminal cistern is preserved but slightly asymmetric. The right lateral ventricle is slightly effaced, and the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is slightly dilated in comparison to the prior CT exam from [**2193-12-12**], concerning for possible early hydrocephalus.  Again, there is significant hypoattenuation of the periventricular white matter, consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic disease.  There are no acute fractures. There is a large subgaleal hematoma overlying the left parietal and occipital regions, with a more focal hyperattenuating region representing a more focal hematoma. The middle ear cavities and included portions of the mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are clear.  The orbits are symmetrical and intact.

Evaluate for interval change.  COMPARISON: Multiple head CTs most recent of [**2196-11-14**].  TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1 and axial fat-saturated T2, FLAIR, gradient echo, and diffusion-weighted images were obtained of the head.  FINDINGS: Multiple areas of restricted diffusion are noted, consistent with acute infarcts in the left anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral artery vascular territories. In addition, areas of acute infarct are noted in the right anterior and posterior cerebral artery vascular territories, involving the right thalamus. There is no evidence of hemorrhagic transformation of these infarcts. There is persistent rightward shift of midline structures which has improved since the previous study, now measuring approximately 6 mm down from 10 mm. Previously noted pneumocephalus is resolving. Residual left subdural hemorrhage and intraparenchymal hemorrhage are again seen, unchanged. The ventricles remain unchanged in size. The major vascular flow voids appear patent.  IMPRESSION: Acute multi vascular territorial infarcts most pronounced in the left hemisphere, as described above. While these can relate to compression of the arteries from the extensive SDH and mass effect, embolic etiology is also in the differential diagnosis. Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] shortly after review on [**2196-11-15**].  The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.      Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 97533**] arrived to the ED intubated for airway protection. She recieved Profiline 9 and several units of FFp to reverse her coagulopathy and went emergently for a left sided craniotomy for SDH evacuation. Post operatively she was left intubated and transferred to the Surgical intensive care unit.  Her exam never improved.  She was followed clinically for the next few days.  An MRI was performed for prognostics.  She was made CMO after a family meeting.  She later expired.

The pacemaker is unchanged. ET tube tip is 6.9 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is not well visualized. The right-sided airspace opacities are again visualized as is volume loss/infiltrate in the left lower lobe. The CP angles are off the film, and thus difficult to assess for effusion on this film. Overall with exception of a new line, there has been no significant interval change  EKG on admission: Atrial fibrillation with a ventricular premature beat and probably two ventricular paced beats. Since the previous tracing of [**2165-5-5**] ventricular pacing is new. The first paced beat appears early and may be related to a non-sensed ventricular premature beat. Clinical correlation is suggested.  Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2165-5-7**] at 3:05:11 PM The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-50 %), most likely due in part to the presence of reduced ventricular filling secondary to atrial fibrillation with relatively rapid ventricular rate. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2165-5-12**] 2:49 PM  Cholelithiasis, and mild gallbladder wall thickening without significant gallbladder distention. Wall thickening may be secondary to underdistention of the gallbladder, or third spacing. Given the minimal gallbladder distention, this is less likely secondary to acute cholecystitis. Evaluation of the common duct in the region of the pancreatic head is limited by ultrasound technique.

Ascites confined to the right upper quadrant with no enhancing wall septations or loculations.  4. Sludge/stones in the gallbladder.  5. Cluster of calcification and hypodensity seen in the head and uncinate process of the pancreas in close proximity may represent a focus of chronic pancreatitis.  6. Equivocal filling defect in the lower CBD and prominant appearance of the region of the papilla. As the patient has a pacemaker, MR evaluation is precluded. ERCP may be useful for further assessment/diagnosis as clinically dictated.  7. A complex cystic mass with solid enhancing rim is seen arising from the left kidney suspecious for a renal cell carcinoma. A targeted renal US should be confirmatory.   Brief Hospital Course: NEURO: The patient was transferred intubated and sedated on the ventilator. Throughout his hospital course, he had daily wake-ups through the sedation and pain medication. Early in his course, he awoke very agitated and not following commands, though was alert, looking around the room and moving all extremities with equal and reactive pupils. He had a history of alcohol use, and had experienced DT's in the past with withdrawal. Consequently, he was maintained on a versed drip and much of the confusion was attributed to possible withdrawal in addition to delerium. With re-evaluation by wake-ups, the patient slowly became more attentive and did not have tremors/shakes, was following commands and communicated that he was not in any discomfort. After extubation, a full neuro exam was normal including strength/sensation, cranial nerves, DTRs, cerebellar exam and speech/memory.  HEENT: The patient was noted to have poor dentition, but no signs of abscess/infection on oral exam. In addition, a CT scan of his head was normal and showed no signs of sinusitis.  PULMONARY: His active problems during this admission were respiratory failure, pneumonia, pleural effusion. The main concern for this patient was that of pneumonia, and strep pneumonia grew in the first sputum culture on admission. He was noted to have a large R pleural effusion, which was tapped, but did not show evidence of empyema. He remained on the ventilator for 17 days. Upon extubation, he did well, had minimal secretions and strong cough, O2 sats in the 90's, work of breathing was easy.  CARDIAC: Active issues during this admission included hypotension and atrial fibrillation, with a history of CAD and CHF.  The hypotension was not fluid responsive and he required levophed pressor support for the first 15 days of hospitalization. This was weened off and he was eventually restarted on all of his home HTN medication. The hypotension was felt to be sepsis physiology, without evidence of new mycardial injury. The atrial fibrillation remained rate controlled, and at first anticoagulation was held [**3-9**] a supratherapeutic INR. This came down to normal levels, and a heparin drip was started and he is being bridged back onto coumadin. In terms of his CHF, an echo revealed only mildly depressed LVEF at 40-50%, and specifics are listed in the report above.  GI/FEN: patient was aggressively volume resuscitated early on, being at the highest 27 liters positive on his i/o's. This eventually was diuresed to a slightly positive volume status, and he will go to rehab with continued diureses. He was started on tube feeds with help from the nutritionists, and will be going to rehab taking PO.  RENAL/GU: The patient came to the service with mildly reduced renal function. Upon receiving his CT his renl function deteriorated and was felt to have contrast nephropathy. Over the next week this resolved to his baseline.He responded well to Lasix and metolazone diuresis as described above.  HEME/ID: Active issues included elevated INR (as described above), and positive cultures included strep pneumonia on sputum and 1/2 bottles of GPC bacteremia. His antibiotic course intially was broad, including levaquin, ceftriaxone, vancomycin and zosyn (broad plus double coverage). This was tailored down to ceftriaxone  to cover the strep pneumonia that was speciated from the sputum. The patient started requiring slightly higher pressor support 1.5 weeks into admission, started spiking nocturnal fevers, and subsequently grew the coag negative staph. He was broadened again for this, though was felt this was likely contaminant. His fever curve and white count normalized and the course of antibiotics was d/c'd. He also developes some diarrhea, but c.diff was negative x 3 (got PO flagyl until negative cx came back) Prophylaxis: remained on sch, then hep gtt/coumadin, pneumoboots and PPi Code: remained full code throughout Dispo: discharge to rehab facility  Medications on Admission: 1.

He had an AICD placed in [**5-30**], and he has had 4 episodes of syncope in the past 2 months. He has been shocked 8x in total, with one episode shocking him four times consecutively.  His history of cardiomyopathy (best attributed to a possible viral illness, per patient report), dates back 8 years.  He has also had long standing a-fib, and it is unclear whether he had the cardiomyopathy or a-fib first as he has never been symptomatic until [**Month (only) 205**]. . He has had 3 hospitalizations for syncope since [**2122-5-21**]. The first of which was [**5-24**] weekend, when his wife reports witnessing him lose consciousness for a few seconds and falling out of a chair.  He was evaluated at [**Hospital 107**] Hospital, was found to have VT, and had an AICD placed on [**2122-5-26**]. . 0n [**7-9**] he woke up from sleep, his AICD fired and 15 minutes later it fired again. He was asymptomatic at the time, he was then taken to [**Hospital3 8544**] and transferred to [**Hospital 107**] hospital.  He was given a loading dose of amiodarone, and converted to lower dose because of dizziness.  He was discharged home and on [**7-17**], he was feeding his horses and felt dizzy and lightheaded, fell to the ground had a jerking motion, his family again witnessed the event.  He didn't feel like he was shocked, and had no palpitations at the time. He lost consciousness and his wife was able to get him into the car and take him to the hospital.  He was initially treated for what was thought to be ischemic chest pain. At [**Hospital3 **] they gave him dilaudid for chest discomfort which caused him to flush and have diaphoresis.  He was transferred to [**Location (un) 796**] and they gave him nitroglycerin, which caused his blood pressure to drop. This entire course he was kept on  amiodarone of 400mg [**Hospital1 **]. He had several 6-7 beat runs of NSVT while there and on Monday [**7-20**] he was intially increased to 400mg TID of amio, then due to persistent episodes of NSVT he was put on IV amio at 1mg/min and transitioned today to 0.5mg/min. . His outpatient cardiologist was concerned for AICD lead migration and on [**7-21**] he was taken to the cath lab for lead replacement. Subsequently he developed 20 beats of VT, at which time the aforementioned amio drip was started at 1mg/minute. Since that time his EKG and tele has shown paced beats and ectopy. . Of note at the OSH his creatinine was 1.1, CE negative x 3, electrolytes WNL, Vanc ppx for lead placement, Coreg was decreased to 25 [**Hospital1 **], Coumadin was held, mag oxide added to keep a-fib better controlled. He was continued on digoxin and lisinopril. BPs ranged 86-126/46-60. . On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative. .

ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function appears severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %) but is difficult to assess due to poor image quality and frequent ventricular ectopy. Relative preservation of basal inferolateral wall function. There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. . IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Dilated left ventricle with severe systolic dysfunction. Right ventricular dilation and dysfunction. . Cardiac Cath Study Date of [**2122-7-28**] COMMENTS: 1.  Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated no angiongraphically apparent disease. The LMCA, LAD, LCx and RCA had no evidence of angiographically apparent disease. 2.  Resting hemodyanamics revealed slightly elevated right sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 15mmHg.  Cardiac output was preserved at 7 l/min.  FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Coronary arteries are normal. 2. Normal ventricular function. . TTE (Complete) Done [**2122-7-29**] Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2122-7-22**], biventricular systolic cavity sizes are smaller and systolic function is slightly improved. .   Brief Hospital Course: 58 year old with a PMH significant for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, chronic a-fib, and ventricullar tachycardia s/p AICD placement on [**2122-5-26**], that was transferred from [**Hospital 107**] Hospital in RI for treatment of ventricular tachycardia with ablation. . # Ventricular tachycardia/dialated cardiomyopathy: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has ventricular tachycardia in the setting of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.  These episodes of ventricular tachycardia started in [**2122-5-21**], he is s/p AICD placement and has had several instances recently of firing of his AICD.  Etiology of his v-tach is likely cardiomyopathy resulting in ectopy.  An initial echo was done the morning after admission and showed dilated left ventricle with severe systolic dysfunction, also right ventricular dilation and dysfunction. Hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic.  He was conitnued on an amiodarone drip of 0.5mg/min until he was taken for EP procedure on [**2122-7-23**]. During the study, they were beginning to warm a site for ablation, and he went into fast VT, so the study was aborted. He converted back to his normal rhythm.  His amiodarone was converted to 200mg PO TID and he still had VT with walking minimal distances, therefore loading dose was increased to 400mg [**Hospital1 **], with plan to transition to 200mg PO BID in one week (starting [**2122-8-1**]).  Now currently undergoing workup for heart transplant.  CT chest completed which showed multifocal small ground-glass nodules predominantly involving the upper lobes, requiring a follow up repeat CT in [**2-24**] weeks as an outpatient. CT abd/pelvis showed hypoattenuating left upper pole renal lesion, most likely benign, but a renal US could be considered as an outpatient.  Hepatitis A,B,C, CMV and HIV serologies were negative.  While on the floor [**2122-7-27**] and [**2122-7-28**] he had increased runs of VTach resulting in AICD firing.  The device fired once on [**2122-7-27**] at 9:30 in the morning when he was walking with the EP team to reproduce symptoms.  On the 7th, he was washing his hair sitting at the sink and he became symptomatic with lightheadedness and flushing.  He had 2 runs of VTach that both resulted in ICD firings at 8:09 and 8:10 in the morning.  He was taken to cath immediately following, and then he was taken to the EP lab for readjustment of his leads.  The lead wires were adjusted to remove slack from the wires.  He tolerated the procedure well and has been without any runs of VTach since.  He received a TTE on [**2122-7-29**] when compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2122-7-22**], biventricular systolic cavity sizes are smaller and systolic function is slightly improved to 30-35%. A right/left heart cardiac catheterization that showed: right dominant system that demonstrated no angiongraphically apparent disease. The LMCA, LAD, LCx and RCA had no evidence of angiographically apparent disease. Resting hemodyanamics revealed slightly elevated right sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 15mmHg.  Cardiac output was preserved at 7 l/min. His volume status was medically managed and he was transitioned back to his home PO Lasix of 20mg daily. . # Contact dermatitis/cellulitis: He developed a likely contact dermatitis after lead replacement at OSH.  The contact dermatitis may have been from the chlorhexadine prep during the procedure as the patient reported that this happened in the past during a prior cath.  The contact dermatitis likely became super-infected and he developed erispelas which was treated successfully with doxycyline for 7 days last dose [**2122-7-28**]. . # Atrial fibrillation: His atrial fibrillation was rate controlled and medically managed.  His coumadin was held secondary to need for cardiac catheterization and he was placed on a heparin drip throughout his admission. . # Sleep apnea: His sleep apnea was medically managed with his CPAP mask at night without complications. . The patient was full code for this admission. Pt was discharged home with further outpt follow-up planned.   Medications on Admission: On Transfer from OSH: .  Coumadin last dose 8/28 for a-fib .  Digoxin 0.25mg PO Q24 .  Lisinopril 40mg PO Q24 .  Coreg 25mg PO Q12 .  Mag Oxide 400mg PO Q24 .  Lovastatin 20mg PO Q24 .  Aldactone 12.5mg PO Q24 .  Amiodarone 0.5mg/min IV  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Ventricular Tachycardia Non-ischemic Cardiomyopathy Acute Renal Failure   Discharge Condition: Alert and Oriented x3 Independent Ambulation   Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **], You were initially admitted to the hospital for loss of consciousness, and were found to have an abnormal heart rhythm called ventricular tachycardia.  You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of your ventricular tachycardia and evaluation for potential ablation.  Unfortunately, the site of the abnormal heart rhythm could not be localized for ablation on this attempt. Your pacemaker/defibrillator settings were adjusted to optimize your own normal heart rhythm and conduction.  You felt significantly improved following the adjustment, and it was decided that your irregular heart rhythm would be controlled with medications. We required you to stay in the hospital for a few days  to best optimize your medications for rhythm control.  During this hospitalization, we also began the evaluation for a heart transplant in case this is something that might benefit you in the future.  Other issues on this hospitalization included a rash involving your chest, shoulders and neck.  It was believed to be related to contact allergy to ""chlorhexidine"", a cleaning [**Doctor Last Name 360**] we commonly use before procedures.  We also believe this skin rash became secondarily infected, for which we treated you with antibiotics.  The following changes were made to your home medications: - Amiodarone was continued at 400mg TWICE daily for 3 more days, then decrease to 400 mg once daily on [**2122-9-2**]. Please continue that dose until you see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. - Start Metoprolol Succinate to control your ventricular tachycardia - STOP taking Carvedilol, Magnesium and Digoxin - DECREASE the dose of Warfarin to 4mg daily. Please check your INR on Monday [**8-3**] with results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. - Start taking clindamycin, an antibiotic, to prevent infection at the ICD site - Start taking Tylenol as needed for pain at the ICD site - Start taking Lorazepam if you need for anxiety or sleep.  Please weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 6 pounds in 3 days.  Check your INR at Dr.[**Name (NI) 87185**] office on Monday [**8-3**]. You should have the INR followed closely now that you are on amiodarone.  Please be sure to have your blood drawn at your doctor's office in [**11-22**] months to check your thyroid and liver function tests because amiodarone can sometimes affect these with time. You will also need to have pulmonary function tests done to make sure the amiodarone is not affecting your lungs.  Your initial CT scan of your chest here showed that you have some non-specific nodules that may be due to an infection, inflammatory disease, or even cancer.  Please talk to your primary care doctor and cardiologist regarding ordering a follow up CT of your chest in [**2-24**] weeks to evaluate whether there is any change.

No acute cardiopulmonary process. 2. Unchanged left upper lobe spiculated mass.  CT CHEST: [**1-26**] FINDINGS: 6.6 x 1.6 cm left upper lobe lesion is less dense and has slightly decreased in size since [**2122-12-2**] when it measured 6.6 x 3 cm. There is stable mild left upper lung traction bronchiectasis. There is near complete resolution of a right middle lobe (4:106) opacity measuring under 5 mm. 2.8 x 5 mm consolidation near the left upper lobe fissure is unchanged since [**2122-12-2**]. Severe centrilobular emphysema is unchanged since [**2122-12-2**]. There is no pleural effusion. ET tube tip is 1 cm above the carina. An NG tube courses through the esophagus and stomach with its tip outside the plane of imaging. Heart size is normal. The main pulmonary artery measures 3.2 cm in diameter. Scattered enlarged mediastinal nodes measuring up to 1.2 cm in diameter are little change since [**2122-12-2**]. Although this exam was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis, the imaged intra-abdominal organs are unremarkable. Bone windows demonstrate no lesion concerning for metastasis or infection. IMPRESSION: 1. Given minimal improvement and benign histology of spiculated left upper lobe mass followup in 6 months can be obtained. 2. Resolution of opacity in the right lung at the junction of the major and minor fissure. 3. Stable severe centrilobular emphysema. 4. ET tube tip is just above the carina in this study, but is in satisfactory position on chest radiograph performed 6 hours after and thus does not need to be repositioned.   Brief Hospital Course: 61 year old female with COPD on 3L home O2 s/p recent admission [**12-2**] for COPD exacerbation and newly diganosed LUL mass now admitted with respiratory distress. . #. Acute hypercarbic respiratory distress/Cough: On admission, the patient was complaining of 3 days of cough and SOB that acutely worsened overnight. She presented to an OSH and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further managment.  She was placed on BiPAP in the ED and transferred to the MICU. She had hypercapneia with a PCO2 of 57 initially, and was placed on non rebreather mask with little improvement, and was then started on non invasive positive pressure ventilation. Patient however tolerated this poorly and required intubation for severe respiratory distress. During acute decompensation, It was noted that patient was taking very high frequency shallow breaths with a constant cough like sound generated in the upper airway. Patient was relatively easy to ventilate and this raised question of paradoxycal vocal cord dysfunction, phrenic nerve injury, etc. During intubation however, vocal cords were noted to be normal in appearance and during serial imaging diaphragms remained symmetrical. Patient was treated with pulse dose steroids and started on Azithromicyn. Given known left upper lobe nodule, a CT scan of the chest was performed and did not show any significant interval change. Patient was sucessfully extubated on [**1-28**] with short NIVPPV bridge. Patient was transfered to medical floor on [**1-28**].  She had an uneventful course and was discharged in stable condition. Pt has been having financial problems and has not been able to afford Tiotropium (Spiriva).  Social work was consulted and she was given Ipratropium instead. Patient was slowly weaned off steroids with taper over the next 2-3 weeks.  #. Fibromyalgia: Difficult to control, with overt anxiety in spite of [**Hospital 17073**] medical regimen. We continued regimen with fentanyl patch, gabapentin, SOMA, darvocet, amitryptline and Propoxyphene  #. Anxiety: Patient with many social stressors and difficult to control anxiety. Given progression of symptoms inspite of agressive therapy, she was to follow up her outpatient psychiatrist to address her anxiety.  # Anemia: During admission noted to be near baseline of 31.

CT scan at [**Hospital1 2025**] showed (-)CT and (-) troponins. Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**10-12**], tox screen (-), CEs (-), primary team managing BP meds and psyche meds. Was being worked up on [**Wardname 836**] for renal failure and balancing HTN meds, when found by NSG staff to be 'unresponsive' with no breathing or radial pulse for 20 seconds. Code blue called, initial blood pressure 80/50 with improvement in mentation to baseline. Two hours after event, noted to have decreasing BPs to 60s with concurrent mental status changes. Repeat BPs in trendelenburg resolved to 110 with return of mentation. She was transferred to the MICU on [**2186-10-15**] for NSG concern of hypotension. . In the MICU she had three more episodes. These were characterized by unresponsiveness, lack of a radial pulse (no femoral pulse was taken), and a post-ictal confusional state most consistent with seizures. Her EKG during these episodes was unremarkable, although she does have a baseline RBBB. Hence, heart block was deemed unlikely. MICU team was suspicious of seizure activity, given complete unresponsiveness to verbal and tactile stimuli, then confusion and return to baseline after episode. Further, given her diabetes and her labile blood pressure, autonomic seizures were of particular concern. She was worked up by multiple teams, including Neurology. Per neurology a head CT was obtained which indicated atrophy w/ mild microangiopathic changes. She was put on EEG monitoring to capture seizure activity however she did not have an episode during monitoring. Other considerations were her baseline psyciatric disorder or medication regimen. She was seen by Psychiatry who do not feel her episodes of hypotension are entirely explained by her bipolar disorder. Finally nephrology was consulted to evaluate a renal source of her labile BP and possible source of hypotensive episodes. Nephrology determined she did not have RAS by US and Captopril study and did not feel that her labile BP was renal in origin. Ultimately, it was felt that a polypharmacy of her BP and anti-psychotic medications were responsible for these episodes. Her BP/ Psych med regimen were tapered and she has been stable for 3 days. She was transferred to [**Wardname **] [**2186-10-17**] for further workup of an anion gap and elevated WBC prior to anticipated discharge to a rehab facility. . Of note, recently hospitalized @QuincyMC for mania, had episode of syncope; workup head CT, head MRI, neck MRA, carotid doppler studies, EEG, CXR, and echocardiogram. Head MRI notable for periventricular white matter changes suggesting small vessel disease. TTE showed normal sized LV with hyperdynamic systolic function and EF of 75%. EEG normal. MRA of neck showed 65-70% stenosis of internal carotids bilaterally.  Past Medical History: 1.

Radiographic Studies: Chest AP (prelim) - Allowing for difference in technique, cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with mild cardiomegaly. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The lungs are clear. . ([**2186-10-13**]) ECG:  NSR, RBBB, LAFB, LVH. unchanged from prior . ([**2186-10-16**]) EEG IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations for symptoms. Routine sampling and automated detection programs recorded no epileptiform features or electrographic seizures. There was some multifocal slowing admixed to the waking background, but this would be assessed better through routine EEG tracings. There were no areas of fixed focal slowing, and there were no epileptiform features. . ([**2186-10-14**]) EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG in the waking and drowsy states due to intermittent brief bursts of mixed frequency slowing seen in the temporal regions bilaterally, independently and asynchronously. The findings suggest underlying subcortical dysfunction in those regions. In a patient of this age, vascular disease would be among the common causes. In addition, there were brief bursts of generalized mixed frequency slowing, more non-specific in etiology. There were no clearly epileptiform features. No electrographic seizures were noted. . ([**2186-10-13**])CT HEAD IMPRESSION:  Moderate degree of atrophy with mild microangiopathic changes. . ([**2186-10-13**]) RENAL US IMPRESSION:  Study limited by patient factors: blood flow to both kidneys, there is no hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, simple cysts in both kidneys . ([**2186-10-16**]) RENAL CAPTOPRIL SCAN IMPRESSION: Essentially normal captopril renal scan. Specifically, no evidence of renal artery stenosis. . ([**10-17**] and [**2186-10-17**]) EEG: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations for symptoms. Routine sampling and automated detection programs recorded no epileptiform features or electrographic seizures. There was some multifocal slowing admixed to the waking background, but this would be assessed better through routine EEG tracings. There were no areas of fixed focal slowing, and there were no epileptiform features. . ([**2186-10-20**]): Chest X-ray IMPRESSION: Improving right lower lobe opacity. . ([**2186-10-20**]): Transthoracic Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.  IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional systolic function. . ([**2186-10-22**]): EKG: Artifact is present. Probable sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Left anterior fascicular block. There is an early transition which is non-specific with subsequent loss of anterolateral R waves associated with anterior and anterolateral ST-T wave changes consistent with probable myocardial infarction. Left ventricular hypertrophy with associated ST-T wave changes. Incomplete right bundle-branch block. Compared to the prior tracing right bundle-branch block is now incomplete. . ([**2186-10-26**]): Liver Ultrasound IMPRESSION: 1. Findings are suspicious for acute cholecystitis and possible focal necrosis and perforation of the gallbladder wall.  2. Right renal cysts. . ([**2186-10-26**]): CT Pelvis/Abdomen/Chest: IMPRESSION:  1. Small amount of free fluid in deep pelvis posterior to the rectum and anterior to the sacrum, without fluid collection or free air. Diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis. Atelectasis and patchy opacities in the lungs, without discrete consolidation suggestive of pneumonia. 2. Renal cysts. 3. Nonspecific fluid-filled distended second portion of duodenum surrounded by mild fat stranding, with slight fat stranding surrounding the pancreatic head. The finding is nonspecific; however, in this patient with elevated white blood cell, duodenitis or early pancreatitis cannot be excluded. Please correlate with laboratory values. 4. Small amount of pericholecystic fluid with questionable sludge. If indicated, please consider gallbladder ultrasound. . ([**2186-10-28**]): CT Abdomen/Pelvis: IMPRESSION: Percutaneous gallbladder drain contained within the gallbladder. The gallbladder is decompressed. No perihepatic or intra-abdominal fluid or hemorrhage is identified. Stable stranding surrounding the second and third portions of the duodenum and pancreatic head . ([**2186-10-30**]): Ultrasound of lower extremities: IMPRESSION: No evidence for deep venous thrombus in bilateral lower extremities. . ([**2186-10-30**]): Head CT w/out contrast: IMPRESSION: Aerosolized secretions in the sphenoid sinus and increased opacity in the right frontoethmoid recess. Please correlate clinically. Otherwise, no significant change, including no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or large recent infarction. . ([**2186-11-3**]): Gallbladder scan: IMPRESSION: 1. Prompt filling of the gallbladder and exit into the duodenum. 2. Patent cholecystostomy drainage tube. 3. No evidence of leak outside of the gallbladder. . ([**2186-11-5**]): Ultrasound of abdomen: IMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of main portal vein thrombosis. The more distal branches of the portal vein were not interrogated. If there is further clinical concern, additional dedicated views of the portal vein vasculature can be performed.  2. Nonvisualization of the gallbladder, likley due to collapsed state. 3. Stable simple-appearing right renal cysts. . ([**2186-11-27**]) Ultrasound of thyroid: IMPRESSION:  1. Completely absent right lobe of the thyroid. Small remnant of the left thyroid lobe is unchanged compared to the prior study. .   Brief Hospital Course: Patient is an 84 year old female with mild dementia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type two, and bipolar disease, who presented on [**2186-10-11**] from [**Hospital3 **] with failure to thrive, and was being worked up for renal failure and balancing hypertension medications, who was found by nursing staff to be 'unresponsive' with no breathing or radial pulse for 20 seconds and transferred to intensive care unit. . # Unresponsive episodes - Patient had initial episode of unresponsiveness, and additional episodes witnessed by the intensive care team. There was concern for seizure activity, given complete unresponsiveness to verbal and tactile stimuli, then confusion and return to baseline after episode. Given her diabetes and her labile blood pressure, autonomic seizures were of particular concern, as was complete heart block (given known RBBB with LAFB) however telemetry tracings remained within normal limits. It was also concerning that her medications could be playing role. She was monitored on telemetry which was unrevealing for a cause, a transthoracic echo did not reveal clear cause, nor did continuous EEG monitoring. Several of her blood pressure medications were held to avoid hypotensive episodes, which ultimately felt to be the a large part of the cause. She had no further episodes after her first transfer out of the intensive care unit on [**2186-10-17**]. . # Hypertension - Patient has historically difficult to control blood pressure, with typical systolic blood pressure of 180's as an outpatient. An abdominal bruit was appreciated on exam. A renal ultarsound showed bilateral flow with doplers. Imaging with captopril was obtained to further evaluate for renal artery stenosis, and was within normal limits. A work up for other secondary causes was initiated, including hyperaldosterone, hyper-renin, hyper-ACTH, and pheochromocytoma. Her work up revealed slightly elevated normetanephrine in serum and urine, as well as very mildly elevated epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, and catecholamines; it was not felt that these were consistent with a pheochromocytoma. An AM cortisol was found to be elevated and resistant to supression by 1mg dexamethasone overnight. Because of that, a CT abdomen/pelvis was obtained on [**2186-10-26**] to look for source of Cushings syndrome or ectopic ACTH secretion-- it showed inflammation around the duodenum and head of the pancreas but no adrenal masses. . Her blood pressure medications were slowly re-introduced, to avoid hypotension, with goal systolic blood pressure greater than 130's to 140's. . At time of discharge, her blood pressure medications were: - Metoprolol 100 mg q8 hours - Clonidine TTS 2 patch weekly - Captopril 75 mg q8 hours . # Arrythmias: Cardiology was consulted early in her stay after episodes of V-[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and PVCs. It was recommended to continue rate control metoprolol, as well as continue her ACE-I. Electrophysiology was asked to see patient again on [**2186-10-22**] for repeated episodes of V-[**Year (4 digits) **]. At that time, amiodarone was initiated at 200 TID, tapered to 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**11-1**], and finally continued at 200 mg daily since [**2186-11-14**].  She had no further arrythmias noted. . # Renal insufficiency - Upon admission, she had worsening of her renal function with a creatinine to 1.7. It was felt that her renal insufficiency was pre-renal in nature, and she was given gentle intravenous fluids. It was thought she had an element of diabetic nephropathy as well. The renal team was consulted and assisted with management of her care. Her creatinine rose to 2.0 at its peak, coinciding with her hypotensive episodes. At time of discharge,  her renal function was stable at 0.8-1.2, and she continued to put out good amounts of urine.. . # Type two diabetes mellitus - Patient was on glipizide at home, however with her worsening renal function and very little PO intake, a sliding scale of insulin was started, and basal insulin was added as needed. At time of discharge, she was on 30 units of lantus in addition to a humalong sliding scale. . # Hypothyroidism - Patient has history of thyroid carcinoma and is status-post thyroidectomy. At time of admission, her TSH was very suppressed, but her free T4 level was within normal limits. Her TSH rose during her stay, peaking at 32. Her T4 studies were found to be low. Endocrine consultation was obtained to assist with management of her thyroid disease, especially with concurrent use of amiodarone and lithium. Her dose of levothyroxine was increased to 300 mcg for several days, then brought down to 175 mcg prior to discharge.  Her TSH remained elevated (15) on a subsequent check on [**12-13**].  This was associated with a normal free T4 (1.5).  After discussion with endocrinology, it was felt that she may not be absorbing well and may be becoming progressively more hypothyroid.  Her tube feeds should be held 30 minutes before and after administering synthroid; she should have her levels followed to ensure that this is effective.  If she is still underreplaced, she may need to have IV levothyroxine. - Her thyroid function tests should be checked and followed up 1-2 weeks after discharge. - An ultrasound of her thyroid was checked to assess for any thyroid disease or cancer recurrence in light of her elevated TSH. The ultrasound was unchanged from prior studies. . # Upper gastrointestinal bleed: On [**2186-11-4**] patient developed a decline in her hematocrit to 19, with guaiac positive stools, then melena and bright red blood per rectum. She was transferred to the intensive care unit, and gastroenterology was consulted. An upper endoscopy revealed bleeding duodenal ulcers that were injected and cauterized. She required a total of 9 units of packed red blood cells during her intensive care stay. Her hematocrit remained relatively stable after her transfer back to the general floors on [**2186-11-8**], until [**2186-11-15**], at which time her hematocrit continued to drift downward and her stools were guaiac positive. Plans were made for a colonoscopy, however, in light of an additional hematocrit drop to 20, a repeat endoscopy was completed on [**2186-11-17**], and a new third duodenal ulcer was noted which was also treated. She received two additional units of red blood cells. . Testing for h. pylori was negative, and gastrin levels were elevated; the elevated gastrin levels were expected in setting of PPI use, and endocrine consultation did not feel there was any additional pathology contributing to the elevated gastrin levels. - [**Hospital1 **] PPI was initiated and should be continued for at least 4 additional weeks, then continued daily. - Patient will need follow up with gastroenterology after discharge, for possible further evaluation of nodules seen during her first endoscopy. . # C. Difficile Colitis: Patient developed diarrhea on [**2186-11-24**], and stool samples revealed c. difficile. She was initiated on treatment with flagyl on [**2186-11-25**], however was refusing oral medications, so intravenous flagyl was administered until [**2186-12-2**] at which time she could receive oral medications via her PEG. She did not have any abdominal pain or distention. Her white blood cell count bumped to >20 at the time of her c. difficile infection.  Then improved.  Around [**12-5**] her WBC count again increased, with no other clear etiology found.  It was decided to change flagyl back to IV, and to add PO vanco.  The plan is to continue IV flagyl and PO vanco until about a week after WBC stopping other antibiotics (cipro for UTI). . # Bipolar Disorder: Patient had recent hospitalization for manic episode at outside hospital. She has long standing history of depression and manic episodes, with numerous prior psychiatric admissions. Her family gave history that many of her prior depressive episodes had started with refusal to eat. . Psychiatry team was consulted at the start of her stay and followed along the entire time. Therapeutic options for her bipolar disease were limited given her multiple serious medical co-morbidities. There was concern during her stay for seizures and serotonin syndrome, however neither was felt to have taken place. She was titrated upward on citalopram to 40 mg (increased from 20 mg on [**2186-11-24**] and increased from 30mg on [**2186-12-11**]). Given her prior success on lithium, which had been stopped due to ""toxicity"" of unclear etiology, the decision was made to re-introduce lithium while in the inpatient setting where the patient could be carefully monitored. 150 mg qHS was started on [**2186-11-8**], and levels were closely followed, with goal level about 0.5. . ECT: Psychiatry felt that one of the best options would be ECT, however the patient continued to adamantly voice her refusal. Several family meetings took place with her primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], primary medical, and psychiatric teams to discuss various options for her severe depression, which was felt to be the main reason for her failure to thrive and poor PO intake. Given her refusal to ECT, legal guardianship would need to be pursued if the patient's family desired to pursue ECT and it was necessary to deem the patient incompetent to make a decision regarding ECT due to her depression. - Remeron was considered, but contraindicated with use of clonidine. - Rilatin was also considered, but contraindicated with her cardiac arrhythmias. - Patient will need continued follow up with psychiatry as an outpatient. . At time of discharge, the patient's mood and affect had improved greatly since her initial presentation, and she appeared much less flat. She was answering questions with complete sentences with improved, though still limited, range of emotions. . # Failure to thrive/Anorexia - Patient continued to refuse to eat and take her medications during most of her stay. As her medical problems cleared, she became more interactive and started to eat small amounts and take her medications. After much discussion and a trial of one week once medically stable to improve PO intake, decision was made to place PEG tube, which was completed on [**2186-12-1**]. - Physical therapy and occupational therapy were consulted and followed along during the patient's stay. - Thyroid management as detailed above. . # Dementia: Patient has history of mild dementia. She was initially on Namenda, however it was held due to her unresponsive episodes, contribution to hypertension, and possible serotonin syndrome. . # Tachypnea: Patient had intermittent episodes of increased respiratory rate, ranging 25 - 30. Her oxygenation remained normal, and her lungs were clear, and she denied any complaints. Several chest x-rays were unrevealing. Her tachypnea improved overall, but she would occasionally have episodes of increased respiratory rate when aroused, agitated (eg by asking several questions). . # Acalculus Cholecystitis: A RUQ US showed possible GB wall necrosis and microperforation. Surgery was consulted and recommended a percutaneous GB tube, which was placed on [**2186-10-27**].  It was assumed that this was the source of her persistent leukocytosis, since her WBC fell to 15 after placement of the tube, but the WBC has since increased. On [**10-28**] after the procedure, levo/flagyl was switched to zosyn for better gram negative coverage.  Vanco was continued. Throughout all this, she has had no fevers, denies abdominal pain and has a relatively benign abd exam w/ no guarding, rebound or RUQ tenderness.  Surgery strongly feels that she does not have an ""acute abdmonial process"" and they want to revisit the idea of an elective cholecystectomy in [**3-18**] weeks.  However, it seems most likely that the necrotic GB was the course of the persistent leukocytosis. - Her drain site remained clean, dry, and intact. - Several cultures from her bile drain were without growth except for one that haad coagulase negative staph, felt to be a contaminant. - Patient's percutaneous gall bladder drain was clamped on [**12-8**] and removed on [**2186-12-11**]. . # Conjunctivitis: Patient completed course of treatment with erythromycin eye drops. . # Oral Thrush: Patient occasionally had evidence of white exudate on her tongue, which was possibly thrush given her very poor PO intake and refusal of mouth care ans swabs. It was possible that thrush was also contributing to her lack of appetite. - Nystatin S+S was initiated.  It can be given on a prn basis for recurrence. . # Elevated Cardiac Enzymes: Patient's cardiac enzymes bumped slightly in setting of her gastrointestinal bleed and relative hypotension. She had no chest pain or EKG changes, and it was felt that she had an episode of demand ischemia. . # Tranaminitis: Patient's transaminases were elevated into the [**2178**], which occurred following her gastrointestinal bleed and episode of relative hypotension when her systolic blood pressure was into the 100s in setting of bleed. It was suspected that she suffered from ischemic process (CEs also bumped) due to hypotension. She had also  been getting tylenol during her during intensive care stay, but not greater than 2 grams per day. - A RUQ US was obtained to rule out thrombosis or other process was completed without any apparent new pathology. . # Thrombocytopenia- Patient developed thrombocytopenia down to 127 at the lowest. This resolved during her stay, and it was thought to be due to her poor nutritional status. - There were no clear offending medications on her medication list. - HIT testing was negative. . # Leukocytosis, fevers: Patient had fevers and leukocytosis intermittently during her stay. Patient's fevers have resolved, but she has had continued leukocytosis.  Patient had definite spike to > 20 with c. difficle infection. - Patient had multiple sets of blood, urine, stool, and bile cultures drawn; her chest x-ray was unchanged. . # Anemia: As discussed above in regards to GIB. Her hematocrit remained stable at 26-28 range prior to discharge. Her anemia was that of chronic disease as well as losses from GI tract. . # Urinary retention: Patient had several voiding trials with removal of her foley with persistent urinary retention. There were no clear offending medications. - Foley replaced. - Patient may need follow up with urology to further management of her foley and retention.  She will  be discharged with foley in place. . # Tremor: Patient had intermittent tremor of her left arm and bilateral feet, which was stable. It was not present except when asked several questions and stimulated. Does not cause patient any distress. Tremor only present when patient stimulated or agitated, not present in sleep or when calm. No other evidence of toxicity or increased tone. .

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hosptial for depression and failure to thrive. For your depression and failure to thrive, you were evaluated by our psychiatrists who started you on two new medications called celexa and lithium. These medications seemed to help your mood and improved your communication. While you were here, you also had several other medical problems including labile hypertension, uncontrolled blood sugars, gastrointestinal bleeding, episodes of unresponsiveness, and infection of your gall bladder. . Your blood pressure and blood sugars were controlled. You were given nutrition via intravenous administration and via a tube going from your nose to your stomach. You were also found to have a new heart arrythmia and transient renal failure. You were seen by psychiatry and treated daily for your depression as we stabilized you medically. . You also developed a bleed from your gastrointestinal tract, and required blood transfusions. . The medicines we stopped were: risperdal, trazodone, diltiazem, glipizide, HCTZ, Imdur, sertraline. The medicines we started were: amiodarone, lansoprazole, insulin, captopril, citalopram, calcium, colace, sucralfate, senna, lithium, vancomycin oral liquid (thru [**12-23**]). The medications we changed were: clonidine (now taking as a patch), levothyroxine (increased to 175 mcg per day), metoprolol (increased to 300 per day).  Please take all of your medications as directed.  Followup Instructions: Please continue your stay at the rehabilitation facility until you are deemed ready to leave. Please follow-up closely with an outside hosptial psychiatrist. . Once you are discharged from you rehabilitation facility please follow-up with a cardiologist of your choice to address your new heart arrhythmia. . Please call your primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1266**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 608**] to schedule an appointment for 2 weeks after discharge. .

The patient has long been awaiting repair of a large inguinal hernia and ventral hernia and had stopped taking his coumadin 10 days prior to presentation (he is on this for atrial fibrillation) in order to get these procedures completed.  Over the week prior to presentation he had also noted worsening left lower extremity edema and increasing abdominal girth with worsening of his preexisting vental hernia.   Other review of systems notable for some nonproductive cough as well as general fatigue and decreased mobility for the past month, which he largely attributed to his impressive hydrocele.  He denied any fevers,chest pain, orthopnea, or PND.  At the outside hospital initial evaluation revealed abdominal wall erythema concerning for cellulitis as well as a swollen left lower extremity.   Ultrasound showed left common femoral vein DVT.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  On arrival he complained of fatigue and discomfort from his large hernias.  No other issues.  Past Medical History: -asbestosis -atrial fibrillation -ureterolysis -RP fibrosis (presumed idiopathic) -omental wrap   Social History: The patient worked as a steam engineer for over 40 years.

Otherwise, tracing is within normal limits  CT Abdomen and Pelvis W/O Contrast [**2196-10-26**]: IMPRESSION AND PLAN: 1. Abnormal soft tissue encasing the retroperitoneal structures, surrounding the aorta and IVC, extending inferiorly along the presacral space. These findings are incompletely characterized without intravenous contrast.  Findings could reflect retroperitoneal fibrosis, though correlation with prior history or any prior imaging would be helpful. The attenuation of this material is not compatible with hemorrhage 2. Complex ventral abdominal wall hernia containing fat, fluid and small bowel, without evidence of obstruction. 3. Large left inguinal hernia, with herniation of fluid and sigmoid colon to the left scrotal sac. 4. Large amount of ascites. 5. Left external iliac, common femoral, and superficial femoral venous thrombosis.  Chest Radiograph [**2196-11-1**]: IMPRESSION: Marked cardiac enlargement predominantly involving the left heart. Extensive bilateral pleural changes including calcifications consistent with previous asbestos exposure. Pulmonary vasculature demonstrates upper zone re-distribution pattern but no conclusive evidence for acute infiltrates.  Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasounds [**2196-11-3**]: IMPRESSION: 1. Occlusive deep venous thrombosis in the common femoral vein extending into the greater saphenous and deep femoral veins. Of note, the proximal extent of thrombus is not defined. 2. No right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.  Spirometry [**2196-11-4**]: Impression: Marked restrictive ventilatory defect with a marked gas exchange defect. The reduced DLCO suggests an interstitial process. There are no prior studies available for comparison.  TTE [**2196-11-4**]: Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no VSD seen. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  Abdominal Ultrasound w/Dopplers [**2196-11-4**]: IMPRESSION: 1. Normal portal venous, hepatic venous, and hepatic arterial flow to the liver. 2. Large amount of ascites  CT Chest W/O Contrast [**2196-11-7**]: IMPRESSION: The constellation of findings including an increasing right pleural effusion which is moderately large, massive hiatal hernia, diffuse ground-glass opacities throughout the lungs probably infective or inflammatory, extensive calcification in multiple pleural plaques with extensive intra- abdominal ascites all contribute to the worsening respiratory status. The presence of an increasing pleural effusion with calcified and noncalcified pleural plaques in the setting of asbestos-related disease raises the remote possibility of mesothelioma.  TTE [**2196-11-8**]: IMPRESSION: Mild concentric hypertrophy with normal biventricular regional and global systolic function. Moderate diastolic dysfunction with elevated PCWP. Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-11-4**], the findings are similar. A paramembranous VSD is not seen on either study (mentioned in initial report). The velocity across the aortic valve is now lower  CT Chest [**2196-11-12**]: IMPRESSION: 1. Large right-sided pleural effusion which has increased in size since the study performed five days prior. Associated compressive atelectasis of the right lung base. Also compressive atelectasis of the left lung base due to large hiatal hernia which is unchanged. 2. Scattered ground-glass opacities throughout both lungs, stable, likely infectious or inflammatory in nature. No focal consolidations. No other significant changes since the prior study.  Renal Ultrasound [**2196-11-12**]: IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Non-diagnostic Doppler evaluation due to patient's inability to hold breath.  CT Chest w/o Contast [**2196-11-14**]: FINDINGS: There has been a slight decrease in size of the large right pleural effusion since the previous CT on [**11-12**] with no pneumothorax. The right lower lobe compressive atelectasis remains similar and the large intrathoracic hiatal hernia now contains peripheral fluid tracking up from the extensive ascites. Otherwise, no change since the CT torso on [**2196-11-12**], and reference to the previous CT report is recommended for complete description of findings.  KUB [**2196-11-25**]: FINDINGS: In the left anterior mid abdomen in the expected location of the patients known ventral abdominal hernia, multiple air-filled and dilated bowel loops are seen, likely involving both small and large bowel. Air is visualized in the rectum.  CT is recommended to rule out large or small bowel obstruction.  Chest Radiograph [**2196-11-26**]: FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph is compared with [**11-22**] and [**2196-11-25**]. There is a large hiatal hernia. There is increase in the right mid lung opacification, which may be atelectasis or pneumonia. There is left basal atelectasis with increasing pleural effusion. Within the left upper lung there is increased opacification, which may be secondary to infection. The right pigtail catheter is unchanged in position. There is atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic aorta.    Brief Hospital Course: This is a 78 year old male with history of paradoxical atrial fibrillation, pulmonary asbestosis, and idiopathic RP fibrosis presenting with cellulitis and increased abdominal distension found to have DVT and with progressive chylous ascites.  1)Chylous Ascites: The patient was noted to have a distended abdomen on presentation and imaging revealed a large amount of ascites.  As the patient had not had a previous history of ascites this was worked up with liver ultrasound that revealed no parenchymal or vascular dysfunction.  Diagnostic paracentesis was obtained on [**2196-11-5**] that showed chylous ascites.  This paracentesis also revealed >250 neutrophils so the patient was empirically started on a five day course of ceftriaxone though he remained afebrile and had no abdominal pain.  After the chylous ascites was discovered primary concern was for a malignancy given the lack of liver disease.  Multiple imaging studies failed to show a mass,  however, multiple fluid cytologies were negative, and the patient's LDH was within normal limits making lymphoma quite unlikely.  Therefore, most likely etiology of the development of chylous ascites was thought to be progressive lymphatic obstruction from RP fibrosis leading to increased hydrostatic pressure and leak into the peritoneal cavity.  The patient had three therapeutic paracentesis on [**11-14**], and [**11-29**] respectively removing 900 cc, 3L and 1 L of chylous fluid respectively.  The second of these revealed a neutrophil count of 280 so led to a second course of five days of antibiotics with ciprofloxacin (as the patient was on cefepime/vanc when the paracentesis occured) which completed on [**2196-11-29**].  All cultures remained negative. Unfortunately, the patient developed secondary chylothorax from fluid tracking up into the pleural space causing respiratory distress.  Attempts were made to slow accumulation of fluid with medical therapies including octreotide and low fat diet then low fat TPN but these were unsuccessful.  General surgery was consulted twice and both times said that surgery to attempt to improve lymph drainage would be unsuccessful as structures are very small and diffuse and post-surgical scarring would likely be as damaging as initial insult.  Case was discussed with thoracic surgery who thought that without clear damage to thoracic duct there was no indication for procedural management. Finally, the possibility of lymphangiogram was discussed extensively with a possible intervention and balloon dilation of cisterna chyli.  Unfortunately, planning MRI would have been required and given patient's progressively poor respiratory status this would have required intubation.  As lymphangiogram and balloon dilation are extremely uncommon procedures, odds of success were not considered high and risk of intubation and likely difficulty extubation was discussed with the family and patient and they elected to pursue comfort focused care.  The possibility of disease modifying therapy for RP fibrosis was discussed with rheumatology, but they said there would be no role for the agents used (almost all of which are immune suppressants) in this acutely sick individual and these things would be unlikely to lead to quick turn-around.  2) Chylothorax/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient was initially noted to be hypoxic soon after admission with desats to the low 90's on room air.  He was seen by pulmonary who attributed this to ascites and his large abdomen causing restrictive pathology in the setting of his underlying pulmonary asbestosis and plaques.  This was supported by his initial PFT's that showed a restrictive pattern.  The patient then became progressively more hypoxic in the setting of an expanding right sided pleural effusion and a large amount of compressive atelectasis.  He was desatting to the low 90's on 4L O2 by nasal cannula when he had his first thoracentesis on [**2196-11-10**] with considerable improvement after the procedure.  By [**11-12**], however, he had reaccumulated almost completely and by [**11-13**] was desaturating again so that an ABG showed of O2 of around 53. Therefore, he was transferred to the unit while he awaited a second thoracentesis.  As he reaccumulated quickly again after that thoracentesis decision was made to place a pigtail catheter, which was placed on [**2196-11-15**].  Over the ensuing days the patient continued to put out greater than one liter of chylous fluid per 24 hour period despite the various interventions meant to reduce chylous ascites mentioned (low fat diets, octreotide, etc...).  On [**2196-11-29**] a pleurodesis was attempted in hopes of allowing eventual removal of the chest tube though interventional pulmonology thought this had a very low probability of being successful.  After the second thoracentesis the patient remained dependent on at least 4L of oxygen by nasal cannula to keep sats> 90%.  On [**11-26**] he desaturated to the 80's on 6L in the context of worsening infiltrates bilaterally but this seemed to improve with holding TPN and was ultimately thought most likely due to volume overload. However, on the day of expected discharge ([**11-30**]), his respiratory status worsened (oxygen saturation of 90-92% on non-rebreather) and he did not wish to use the mask. Given that comfort was the goal, he was transitioned back to nasal cannula, and oxygen saturations were no longer followed.  3) Nutrition/Protein Loss: Initially the patient was allowed to eat a regular diet but in attempts at medical management he was converted to a low fat, high protein diet and then made NPO with TPN. Despite TPN his protein and albumin continued to fall presumably due to losses in the chest tube.   After he became quite volume overloaded on [**2196-11-27**] and given the minimal reduction in fluid output seen even with the TPN modifications TPN was stopped as of [**11-27**] and he was allowed to eat for comfort.  He and his family understand he will ultimately continue to become malnourished and weaker but given poor toleration of TPN and comfort focused care this was considered acceptable by them.  4) Health Care Associated Pneumonia: The patient was noted to have intermittently elevated white counts and on [**2196-11-19**] had a right upper lobe infiltrate on chest radiograph and had purulent sputum.  Therefore, he received 9 days of cefepime/vancomycin with some improvement in his sputum production and stable chest radiograph findings.  White count failed to trend reliably. He was never febrile.  5) LLE DVT: He was initially on heparin gtt then transitioned to be therapeutic on coumadin.  He was transferred back to heparin gtt once on the medical service and continued on this throughout his course there to make procedures feasible without needing a long warfarin wash-out. Anticoagulation with medications other than unfractionated heparin (enoxaparin, warfarin) was not optimal given his renal failure and poor nutritional status.  6)Cellulitis: The patient initially received a dose of penicillin then a few days of cefazolin with minimal improvement in his abdominal rash.  He then received 10 days of vancomycin as well as steroid cream after dermatology thought the abdominal rash could be a contact dermatitis.  This led to resolution of his abdominal rash.  7) Likely drug rash: Later in his hospitalization (around [**11-19**]-15th) he developed a morbilliform eruption on his trunk in the context of receiving a dose of piperacillin-tazobactam in the ICU.  This medication was stopped an his rash resolved.  8) Hypotension: The patient developed relative hypotension in the hospital.  Multiple blood cultures were negative and this seemed stable without mental status changes or end organ dysfunction (except some worsening of his CKD).  This was thought likely due to poor cardiac return due to massive third spacing from his protein losses and perhaps external compression of the IVC by his abdomen.  9) Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's baseline Cr is unclear. At presentation Cr was 2 then trended down to 1.5 before trending up again in the setting of worsening ascites and his general deterioration.  Renal was consulted twice and ultimately concluded this was likely due to poor preload and forward flow from the heart in the context of his third spacing and massive abdominal distension.  He never became oliguric or anuric.  10) Atrial fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response while his nodal agents were being held.  This broke with diltiazem and he was restarted on this medication with good rate control.  11) Goals of Care: After extensive discussion with the family and patient about the lack of options for reversing the patient's chylous ascites accumulation and subsequent respiratory compromise and progressive protein wasting they elected to pursue comfort focused care.  Reasonably benign interventions (i.e. antibiotics, pleurodesis through a preexisting chest tube) were pursued but other aggressive cares were not.  Similarly oral feeds were pursued even in the face of a possible SBO for the patient's comfort and happiness.  His major goal was comfort and the family and patient understood his poor prognosis. When his respiratory status deteriorated on [**11-30**] (as above), further diagnostics and interventions were not pursued, and he was given morphine. He passed away in the evening of [**11-30**], and his family was notified. Autopsy was requested and will be performed at [**Hospital1 18**].  Medications on Admission: 1.

He had had a recent admission to this hospital for hypertensive urgency presented to the emergency department with hypotension after taking his 5 BP medication just subsequent to his dialysis yesterday.  His blood pressure normalized after administration of 2 boluses of 1L normal saline.  He was admitted to the medicine service.  Throughout his brief stay, he remained hemodynamically stable with blood pressure in the normotensive range.  At no time did he exhibit signs of cardiogenic shock or sepsis.  It was felt that his symptomatology and hypotension was related to his taking blood pressure medications to soon after his dialysis session.  It was felt that it was safe for the patient to go home.  He was advised to not take any of his blood pressure medications in the 4 -6 hour time period after each dialysis session and given a prescription and schedule to take two of his antihypertensive medications in the morning, and two at night.  This was also communicated to the attending physician that day, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 4154**] who agreed with this.  Discharge of patient was to be arranged pending final evaluation from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4154**].  The patient, however, grew impatient saying he needed to be at work soon.  He was given a letter excusing him from work and he seemed satisfied with this and said he would wait for the attending. The patient, however, did not wait for the attending's final evaluation and subsequently left AMA soon thereafter.  Attending was notified.  In summary this is a 44 year-old gentleman with hypertension and end stage renal disease on hemodialysiswho presented with hypotension after taking all four blood pressure medications shorly after a hemodialysis session.  His hypotension resolved and was hemodynamically stable upon leaving AMA.  Reasons for leaving AMA, not entirely clear.  Issues and plan as follows: . 1) Hypotension: Likely from taking BP medications too soon after HD.  Given schedule for taking 2 medications in morning, two at night.  Advised not to take antihypertensive medications at least 4-6 hours after hemodialysis. - ruled out for MI  . 2) ESRD: M,W,F hemodialysis. - continue Renagel, calcium acetate - Renal service notified. . 3) Metabolic abnormalities: Alkalosis/hyperkalemia: K Trended down to normal range, alkalosis resolved,  long term managment with dialysis.  4) FEN: renal, low sodium diet . 5) PPx: pneumoboots, Protonix . 6) Full Code  7) Left AMA, reasons unclear.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None.  History of Present Illness: ONCO-MED HOSPITALIST ADMISSION NOTE . 61 year old gentleman with COPD, stage IV NSCLC mucinous adenocarcinoma and recent PE who presents with dyspnea. He reports sudden-onset worsening of respiratory status on the morning of admission without associated productive cough, fevers/chills, CP, or other symptoms. . Of note, patient was recently readmitted in early [**2173-10-28**] for SOB/dyspnea, at which time a new LLL consolidation was seen. He was provided with one dose of Vanc/Cefepime, and started on a morphine drip in concert with patient's HCP as well as patient wishes. Improvement in clinical status was noted overnight and his morphine drip was discontinued.  His acute respiratory decompensation was attributed to a mucus plug, aspiration, perhaps with contributing atalectasis. He was continued albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers, as well as enoxaparin [**Hospital1 **] for his recent PE's.  Antibiotics were not resumed at time of discharge. After discharge, blood cultures from [**2173-11-3**] grew Fusobacterium Nucleatum in one out of two bottles.  The patient was contact[**Name (NI) **] on [**2173-11-6**] regarding this lab result, and did not feel any different since discharge from the hospital.  Repeat blood cultures at his outpatient oncologist failed to reveal positive cultures.  Since his recent discharge, discussion regarding hospice care has been continued with his oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 45322**], given the patient's poor prognosis. . In the ED, initial vitals recorded were a RR of 32. Labs showed hyponatremia with a sodium of 129, otherwise unremarkable CMP. CBC with WBC count of 16.0 with 97.3 PMN's and 2.4 % lymphocytes.  HCT of 30.6, platelets of 508. Coags showed INR of 1.2, PTT of 31.8. CXR showed Stable right-sided pleural effusion and post-obstructive consolidation, increasing left pleural effusion with basal atelectasis. Patient had his pleurex catheter drained with 300 cc's of straw colored fluid aspirated. He was administered albuterol/ipratropium nebs, vancomycin/zosyn, as well as lorazepam and methylprednisolone. . In MICU, VS: 96.9 103 131/74 14 90%4L NC. He endorsed feeling hungry. His respiratory status stabilized after clearing mucous plug, but still requiring 4-5L NRB. No antibiotics were given as low suspicion for acute infection. He improved with time, albuterol/ipratropium nebs. He was continued on lovenox for recent PE. In addition, as a large component of dyspnea was anxiety, patient was placed on standing clonazepam 1mg TID. Palliative care was consulted for assistance with pain control and was made DNR/DNI. Of note, he was found to be growing G+ cocci in 1 of 2 Bcx bottles, was started on IV vancomycin and was transferred out of ICU. . ROS: He denies F/C/S, N/V, headache, dizziness, chest pain, abdominal pain, back pain, constipation, diarrhea, hematochezia, urinary symptoms, or rash.  All other ROS were negative.

OTHER PERTINENT LABS [**2124-3-16**]  TSH-2.5 . IMAGING CXR ([**2124-3-15**]): FINDINGS: Single frontal view of the chest was obtained. There are low lung volumes, accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Fullness of the hila and mild perihilar opacities may relate to mild fluid overload and/or crowding of vessels. No definite focal consolidation is seen. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable. IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with possible mild fluid overload. Consider repeat with better inspiration when patient able. . EKG [**2124-3-15**]: HR 120, atrial tachycardia, Nl axis, normal interval, nl R wave progression, no ST-changes. [**2124-3-19**]: NSR 84 . Microbiology: [**2-/2041**] Blood culture (FINAL): NO growth MRSA screen: NO MRSA isolated . [**3-17**] TTE The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to extensive apical akinesis and severe hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle with the exception of the basal posterior and lateral walls, which are relatively preserved. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] A left ventricular apical mass/thrombus cannot be excluded with certainty. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe mitral annular calcification. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2123-10-7**], there has been marked further deterioration of left ventricular contractile function as well as marked increased in mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. . [**3-19**] R FEMORAL ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: Focused vascular ultrasound of the right groin, the common femoral artery and vein was performed with [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-scale, color Doppler, and spectral analysis. Findings are concerning for an AV fistula between the right common femoral artery and vein, just proximal to the greater saphenous vein takeoff, where there is turbulent, mixed broad waveform and suggestion of connection between the two vessels. No evidence of pseudoaneurysm is seen. No evidence of hematoma is seen in the right groin. IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for AV fistula between the right common femoral artery and vein. No evidence of pseudoaneurysm.   Brief Hospital Course: 69F with HX SVT, ESRD, CAD, PAD, and sCHF p/w symptomatic atrial tachycardia to the 130s during outpatient dialysis; admitted for management of this chronic problem, previously refractory to pharmacologic therapy and a 1st ablation attempt on [**2124-3-2**]; during this admission she underwent a 2nd ablation attempt which was not wholly successful (some intermittent Atach episodes thereafter), and which was c/b a post-procedure R femoral AVF. . # ATRIAL TACHYCARDIA Admitted from HD w/atrial tachycardia, a chronic intermittent issues. Usually asymptomatic; now symptomatic w/lightheadedness at HD. Admission EKG here documented atrial tachycardia to the 130s, no ischemic changes. Hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic despite HR intermittently to the 130s. Underwent successful ablation here on [**2124-3-16**], after which she was in NSR for >24h. However, she did flip into atrial tachycardia intermittently thereafter, with HR max 120s - episodes self-resolved, occurred primarily during HD, and were asymptomatic. Attempts to increase beta-blockade beyond Toprol 75mg PO QD were limited by BP. Patient will see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (electrophysiologist) in outpatient follow-up in ~1 week to discuss any possible future intervenion. In the interim, at home and at HD, her inpatient cardiologist felt comfortable tolerating asymptomatic atrial tachycardia to the 120s-130s. We note that on [**3-16**], post-procedure recovery was initially complicated by anaesthesia-induced hypotension (requiring overnight ICU obs) and later by the slow development of a R femoral AVF (documented by ultrasound, see results). For the R femoral AVF, vascular surgery consult service evaluated her daily and recommended conservative management vascular surgery f/u in 4 weeks. Expect spontaneous resolution. . # CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE, LVEF 20% TTE during this admission demonstrated LVEF 20%, MR 4+ TR 4+, all worse than prior. MR [**First Name (Titles) 9413**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on exam. Ischemic vs. tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy suspected as underlying cause. She was euvolemic during admission; volume/BP control primarily via BB and dialysis. Imdur was stopped due to relative hypotension (SBP 90s-110s). Metoprolol dose increased to Toprol 75 mg QD. We note hx lisinopril allergy; considered started [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] but deferred this for outpatient f/u in setting of borderline BPs. . # ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION Patient's BP fell to 75/palp when working w/PT on [**3-20**]. Family confirmed that she suffers from lightheadedness when she first rises to stand, especially after watching television (she like Westerns). Imdur had already been stopped prior to this PT eval; BB was subsequently lowered from Toprol 100 QD to 75 QD (further decrease thought inappropriate given need to control atrial tachycardia). She worked with PT twice more and was instructed on techniques to decrease orthostatic symptoms and prevent falls. Outpatient PT arranged at discharge. . # DM2 Patient has known DM2, not on either oral hypoglycemics or insulin. Insulin needs here ranged from 8-12U/day. Discussed initiating insulin w/pt, but she refused. [**Month (only) 116**] require ongoing BS evaluation/discussion of therapeutic options as an outpatient. . INACTIVE ISSUES . # CAD Patient w/ significant 2V CAD (LAD stented w/BMS x2, RCA occluded 100% on [**9-/2123**] cath). EKGs negative for evidence of restenosis or ischemic changes. No chest pain or dyspnea. Continued Plavix and ASA 81mg. . # CHRONIC ANEMIA Chronic; family confirms that she receives Epo at outpatient HD. Denies h/o melena or GI bleeding. Hct remained stable ~30. . # ESRD: Longstanding, on qMWF schedule. No difficulty w/LUE AV fistula access. Atrial tachycardia episodes occurred primarily during HD sessions, were asymptomatic and self-resolved within minutes. See above for cardiology plan re: any future asymptomatic ATach during HD. . # Hx Hypothyroidism s/p thyroidectomy TSH wnl at admission. Continued home dose of synthroid. . # Hx HLD Continued home statin. . # Hx Seizure disorder One seizure in the past per patient. Continued home Keppra. No seizure activity observed. . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES 1. EP to reassess for possible future repeat ablation attempt 2. DM2 - Pt refused discussion of insulin, had 8-12U/day insulin requirement. [**Month (only) 116**] need further discussion/education about risks of continuing with dietary control and without any medical management. 3. Worsening sCHF (35%->20%). Suspected declining LVEF due to tachycardia-induced crdiomyopathy [**2-17**] long-standing Atrial Tachycardia. Suggest repeat TTE in [**4-21**] mos to reassess LVEF, MR and TR once rate better controlled. 4. Follow-up HR, BP, orthostatic VS. Toprol dose increased to 75mg po DAILY, imdur stopped. 5. Follow-up logistics of outpatient PT, recommended by inpatient PT consult 6. Monitor exam for changes in R femoral AVF (vascular surgery f/u arranged) 6.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **], . It was a pleasure taking care of you when you were admitted for rapid heart rate during dialysis similar to the episodes you have experienced in the past. . During this hospital stay, you underwent an ablation procedure. The procedure was successful - you developed occasional rapid rates but eventually returned to [**Location 213**] sinus rhythm. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] will see you in follow-up to discuss whether you might need another ablation procedure if you develop rapid heartrate again.  We noticed that you were lightheaded and had slightly low blood pressures when you first stand up, especially on dialysis days. You worked with a physical therapist here who gave recommendation about standing up slowly to avoid lightheadedness and falls. We also adjusted your medications to minimize symptoms.  You had elevated blood sugars here, to >300 on more than 1 occassion. On average, you received 12 units of insulin/day to control your blood sugar. You did not want to start diabetes medications. You should discuss this further with your PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3**] you should be taking medication to control high blood sugar at home.  The following changes were made to your medications: CHANGED METOPROLOL FORMULATION: START TAKING TOPROL XL 75 MG PER DAY (EXTENDED RELEASE). DON'T TAKE YOUR OLD METOPROLOL/LOPRESSOR PILLS. STOP TAKING IMDUR  Review your medication list with your PCP and cardiologist at your next appointment. Please keep your follow-up appointments as scheduled below.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for biliary obstruction & signs of shock liver. ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: INDICATION: Cirrhosis, hyperbilirubinemia. FINDINGS: A bedside portable examination was performed. The study is markedly limited due to body habitus. Portal vein is patent, but demonstrates reversal of flow, new since [**2168-10-11**], probably related to underlying cirrhosi. No gross intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. Spleen is slightly enlarged, measuring 12.1 cm in length. Limited examination of the kidneys shows no frank evidence of hydronephrosis. IMPRESSION: 1) Limited examination, showing reversal of portal venous blood flow, new since [**2168-10-11**]. 2) No gross evidence of hydronephrosis.   Brief Hospital Course: Patient underwent esophagogastectomy with rou-en-y reconstruction for longstangind history of esophageal stricture and gastric atony on [**2170-2-22**].  Overnight patient develop increase in need for fluid to support blood pressure as well as a bile leak from one of the anastomosis.  Then patient developed increased in abdominal bladder pressure.  She was taken urgently to the operating room for the revision of the anastomosis and wash out.  Her abdomin was unable to be closed so bogata bag was placed.  After the operation, patient continued to require fluid and pressors for blood pressure support.  Then patient became septic.  She was started on Xigris for treatment of septic shock.  She improved but continued to require full ICU care. Neurologically, she moved all extremities but required sedation and paralysis to help with oxygenation.  Cadiovascularlly, she was started on Xigris which initally helped with decreased in need for pressors but she continued to need pressors for blood pressure support.  She also developed atrial fibrillation which lead to need for amiodarone drip for a period of time.  She continued to need mechanical support and the need for supported increased for both oxygenation and ventilation over time. Patient also developed renal insuffiency.  Patient also developed shocked liver with coagulation parameters not responding to replacements.  On [**2170-3-5**], she developed leukocytosis to 40s and she was taken to the operating room for a washout.  Subsequently she developed multi-organ failure. After a discussion with family patient was made comfort measures only and she died after withdrawing her ventilation.

Patient was being transported to [**Hospital1 336**]/[**Hospital1 **] for evaluation of vomiting x few days (2 or 4 days, depending on whose report you read). He was only responsive to verbal stimuli per EMS notes. and per evaluation from the ambulance, his BP was 70/30, RR 30s and HR 60s. Of note, patient has been having poor appetite x 4 days. KUB was apparently negative for obstruction. . From his RN home, he was noted to have: - Cr of 2.9 BUN of 65 on [**2107-9-24**] and digoxin level of 1.5 - INR of 1.07 on [**2107-9-24**] and Pt of 11.6 . In the ED: He was alert and following commands. Initially BP responded to fluids and was in the 110s, then dropped to 67/59 - started on dopamine. He was also initially bradycardic to the 40s-50s (but then 110s for unclear reasons). Dopamine was titrated to 10mcg/kg/min and then was placed on levophed at 0.5mcg/kg/min and then titrated up to 3mcg/kg/min. On arrival to the floor, he was on only Levophed at 3mcg/kg/min. - increased pulmonary congestion and BiPAP was applied. - received 7L NS in ED - got Levo/Flagyl/Vanco . Access: A L groin was attempted. Then a R IJ was attempted - which led to guidewire getting stuck in the IVC filter. This was removed by Vascular Surgery. Finally, a R femoral line was placed.

Normal left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the distal half of the inferior, septal, and anterior walls. The remaining segments are mildly hypokinetic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-13**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial  effusion. IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with extensive regional dysfunction c/w multivessel coronary disease. Moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis. Mild aortic regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Based on [**2097**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended). Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data. . [**2107-9-26**] Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound: IMPRESSION: 1.

Brief Hospital Course: Patient is an 80 year old male with history of CAD, CHF, dementia, schizophrenia, chronic renal insufficiency, cardiac dysrythmia who was admitted for sepsis. . 1. Septic shock/infectious disease issues: Patient presented from his nursing home with hypotension, leukocytosis, acute on chronic renal failure, indicating sepsis.  Initial studies demonstrated CXR with right lower lobe pneumonia, and u/a that was positive.  Patient also with some cellulitis in left lower extremity.  Therefore, intially thought source of sepsis was pneumonia vs UTI vs cellulitis.  Cortisol stimulation test was negative, ruling out adrenal insufficiency on admission.  The patient was fluid rescusitated and initially started on levaphed for pressor support.  He was maintained on vancomycin and zosyn for broad spectrum antibiotics coverage. Shortly after admission, patient had improved blood pressure and levaphed pressor was weaned off.  Blood cultures from admission grew coag negative staph, 2/2 bottles, likely source of this infection being his left lower extremity cellulitis.  Therefore he was maintained on vancomycin to complete a 14 day course. Wound care nursing was also consulted and dressing changes were applied per their recommendations. For his pneumonia, sputum culture did not grow any bacteria. Urine legionella antigen was negative.  Therefore patient was empirically treated with vancomycin to complete a 14 day course, as above, and zosyn, which was converted to levofloxacin on discharge, for gram negative coverage to complete a 7 day course. For his presumed UTI, the patient had 2 positive U/A's during the hospital course, with negative urine cultures.  The 3rd u/a prior to discharge was negative, with a corresponding negative culture. Therefore, upon discharge, patient had a very stable blood pressure, stable oxygenation off of oxygen, and was discharged on vancomycin to complete a 14 day course and levofloxacin to complete a 7 day course (started with zosyn).  He had a PICC line placed prior to discharge. . 2. Cardiac: A. Ischemia:  Patient has a history of coronary artery disease. On presentation, EKG demonstrated right bundle branch block (last EKG in our system is from [**2092**] that demonstrates no RBBB - however, obtained outside hospital records that does show RBBB, so not new).  On admission, cardiac enzymes were elevated. Cardiology was therefore consulted.  Patient was thought to be having a demand ischemic event, and therefore was started on heparin drip to complete 48 hours per cardiology recommendations.  His outpatient aspirin dose was increased from 81mg to 325mg daily.  He initially could not be on beta blocker therapy given his hypotensive sepsis.  Upon resolution of his hypotension, his outpatient lopressor was re-started and titrated up to his outpatient dose of 50mg [**Hospital1 **].  His CK peaked at 372, and cardiac enzymes trended down throughout remainder of hospital course.  No plans for cardiac catheterization given the nature of his MI in setting of sepsis, and his co-morbid conditions. B. Rhythm:  Patient had a known history of some cardiac dysrhythmia, but unknown type.  During hospital course, patient was noted to have strange rhythm on telemetry and EKG.  The electrophysiologist cardiologists were curbsided, and believed the patient's rhythm to be due to wenkebach rhythm.  They recommended no further intervention and believed that the patient's outpatient digoxin could be discontinued.  Otherwise patient was maintained on lipitor, as above. C. Pump:  Patient has a history of CHF, and was on lisinopril and lasix and digoxin as and outpatient.  All of these medications were held on admission due to the patient's renal failure and sepsis.  ECHO on admission demonstrated diffuse disease, EF 20-25%, mod-severe aortic stenosis, mild aortic regurgitation, mild-mod mitral regurgiation.  Upon resolution of the patient's sepsis/hypotension, his lisinopril was restarted. Digoxin and lasix were not restarted.  Spironolactone was initiated given the patient's heart failure and low EF.  He remained euvolemic during remainder of hospital course. . 3. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Patient with a history of chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatnine thought to be 2.0.  On day of admission, Cr was elevated at 2.9 and quickly rose to peak of 5.6.  Patient was fluid rescusitated and Cr dropped throughout admission and was down to 1.1 at time of discharge. During hospital course, the patient's lisinopril, lasix, and digoxin were held due to the patient's renal failure.  Only his lisinopril was restarted, as above.  His antibiotics were renally dosed and adjusted throughout hospital course. . 4. Anemia:  Patient had a hematocrit of low 30's on admission, trended down to low of 26 during hospital course.  Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  Patient was transfused 1 unit of pRBC for Hct of 26, given his history of CAD, and Hct bumped appropriately to 29, and remained stable during remainder of .  ? baseline.  Hct increased to 29 w/ 1 unit pRBC.  Plan to: - will f/u iron studies - guaiac all stools - tfs to keep hct > 28 - moniter . 5. Facial eccymoses and erythema: Patient had noted left sided peri-orbital facial erythema and eccymoses on exam on [**9-27**]. Radiology and opthalmology were contact[**Name (NI) **] as this was thought possibley secondary to peri-orbital cellulitis.  MRI scan was initially considered for futher evaluation.  However, opthalmology evaluated the patient and thought it was unlikely to be peri-orbital cellulitis, and therefore no imaging was necessary.  This exam finding was thought likely secondary to the heparin drip that the patient was on for his cardiac issues, and continued to improve throughout remainder of hospital course once heparin was discontinued. . 6. Guidewire caught on IVC filter:  Patient had a right IJ guidewire get caught in his IVC filter during his ED course. This was removed by vascular surgery.  Patient was given 1U PRBC in ED for fear of bleed.  Hematocrit remained stable.  Nothing further was done. . 7. Mental status:  Patient was somnolent on admission, likely secondary to his infectious status.  He returned quickly to his baseline mental status that included being awake, alert, pleasant, responsive, oriented only x 1 to person.  He was written for zyprexa 5mg PRN for agitation, but did not receive any during hospital course. . 8. Peripheral vascular disease:  Patient had dopplerable pulses on this admission. . 9. Coagulopathy: Patient on coumadin as outpatient for dysrhythmias and lower extremity DVT.  Coumadin was initially held given the patient's poor clinical condition.  It was restarted during hospital course, and he was discharged on his outpatient dose of 1mg qhs, with a subtherapeutic INR.  It should be addressed with his outpatient primary care physician whether or not to continue his coumadin, given his fall risk and his risk vs benefit ratio. . 10.  Hypernatremia:  Patient was quite hypernatremic during hospital course, with sodium of 151 on admission.  This was thought likely a hypovolemic hypernatremia.  His hypernatremia improved slightly with initial fluid rescusitation.  The patient then proceded to get free water boluses per his NG tube, which continued to control his hypernatremia. . 11.  Nutrition:  Patient underwent speech and swallow evaluation early in hospital course which he failed.  Therefore he had an NG tube placed and received tube feeds and medications per his NG tube.  Upon improved alertness, patient underwent a repeat bedside speech and swallow evaluation, which he also failed. Following this, patient lost his NG tube.  He therefore had an IR placed post-pyloric feeding tube to continue his tube feeds and medications.  He was discharged with this tube in place with plans for a repeat speech and swallow upon improvement at rehab. If he fails this, the issue of PEG tube placement should be brought up with his [**Name (NI) 5993**], his sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 976**]. . 12.  Prophylaxis:  Patient was initially maintained on heparin drip for his non ST elevation MI for DVT prophylaxis, which was changed to subcutaneous heparin after 48 hours.  He was also re-started on his coumadin as above.  He was also maintained on a PPI. . 13. Access:  PICC line was placed prior to discharge. . 14. Code: DNR/DNI - per nursing home records and confirmed by [**Name (NI) 5993**], his sister. . 15.

Please follow these guidelines unless your physician has specifically instructed you otherwise. Please call our office nurse if you have any questions. Dial 911 if you have any medical emergency.  ACTIVITY:  There are restrictions on activity. On the side of your amputation you are non weight bearing until cleared by your Surgeon. You should keep this amputation site elevated when ever possible.  You may use the other leg to assist in transferring and pivots. But try not to exert to much pressure on the amputation site when transferring and or pivoting. Please keep knee immobilizer on at all times to help keep the amputation site straight.  No driving until cleared by your Surgeon.  PLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:  Redness in or drainage from your leg wound(s) .  Watch for signs and symptoms of infection. These are: a fever greater than 101 degrees, chills, increased redness, or pus draining from the incision site. If you experience any of these or bleeding at the incision site, CALL THE DOCTOR.  Exercise:  Limit strenuous activity for 6 weeks.  Do not drive a car unless cleared by your Surgeon.  Try to keep leg elevated when able.  BATHING/SHOWERING:  You may shower immediately upon coming home. No bathing. A dressing may cover you??????re amputation site and this should be left in place for three (3) days. Remove it after this time and wash your incision(s) gently with soap and water. You will have sutures, which are usually removed in 4 weeks. This will be done by the Surgeon on your follow-up appointment.  WOUND CARE: Sutures / Staples may be removed before discharge. If they are not, an appointment will be made for you to return for staple removal.  When the sutures are removed the doctor may or may not place pieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision. These will stay on about a week and you may shower with them on. If these do not fall off after 10 days, you may peel them off with warm water and soap in the shower.  Avoid taking a tub bath, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub for four weeks after surgery.  MEDICATIONS:  Unless told otherwise you should resume taking all of the medications you were taking before surgery. You will be given a new prescription for pain medication, which can be taken every three (3) to four (4) hours only if necessary.  Remember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you should increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet. (Check with your physician if you have fluid restrictions.) If you feel that you are constipated, do not strain at the toilet. You may use over the counter Metamucil or Milk of Magnesia. Appetite suppression may occur; this will improve with time. Eat small balanced meals throughout the day.  CAUTIONS:  NO SMOKING! We know you've heard this before, but it really is an important step to your recovery. Smoking causes narrowing of your blood vessels which in turn decreases circulation. If you smoke you will need to stop as soon as possible. Ask your nurse or doctor for information on smoking cessation.  Avoid pressure to your amputation site.  No strenuous activity for 6 weeks after surgery.  DIET :  There are no special restrictions on your diet postoperatively. Poor appetite is expected for several weeks and small, frequent meals may be preferred.  For people with vascular problems we would recommend a cholesterol lowering diet: Follow a diet low in total fat and low in saturated fat and in cholesterol to improve lipid profile in your blood. Additionally, some people see a reduction in serum cholesterol by reducing dietary cholesterol. Since a reduction in dietary cholesterol is not harmful, we suggest that most people reduce dietary fat, saturated fat and cholesterol to decrease total cholesterol and LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein-the bad cholesterol). Exercise will increase your HDL (High Density Lipoprotein-the good cholesterol) and with your doctor's permission, is typically recommended. You may be self-referred or get a referral from your doctor.  If you are overweight, you need to think about starting a weight management program. Your health and its improvement depend on it. We know that making changes in your lifestyle will not be easy, and it will require a whole new set of habits and a new attitude. If interested you can may be self-referred or can get a referral from your doctor.  If you have diabetes and would like additional guidance, you may request a referral from your doctor.  FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT:  Be sure to keep your medical appointments. The key to your improving health will be to keep a tight reign on any of the chronic medical conditions that you have. Things like high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol are major villains to the blood vessels. Don't Please call the office on the first working day after your discharge from the hospital to schedule a follow-up visit. This should be scheduled on the calendar for seven to fourteen days after discharge. Normal office hours are 8:30-5 Monday through Friday.  .  PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL THE OFFICE WITH ANY OTHER CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT ARISE     Followup Instructions: Call Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] office for follow up in 3 weeks.

Female with a history of gastric bypass 4 years ago w/ multiple recent complications including spinal abscess, osteomyelitis, intraabdominal leak, spinal osteomyelitis with abscess, sepsis who was initially admitted for weakness. . On review of her initial note it appears she was discharged following the aforementioned complicated course on a course of first Clindamycin x [**1-28**] wks which was changed to Levaquin and Vancomycin. On the day of her admission she was found by her [**Month/Day (3) 269**] to be extremely weak specifically with lower extremity weakness but no bladder/bowel incontinence or anaesthesia. She initially was seen at [**Hospital3 4107**] and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] as pt did not want further care at [**Hospital1 112**]. . She was then admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service where she was noted to have hypokalemia due to increased K+ wasting though it is unclear as to why this was occuring. She was also noted to be in [**Last Name (un) **] thought to be secondary to Vancomycin toxicity (her reported Vancomycin was noted to be 80?). An MRI was obtained given her lower extremity weakness and was notable for worsening L4-5 disco-osteomyelitis. Orthopaedics were consulted and pt underwent a diskectomy, debridement and anterior fusion on [**10-20**]. Following induction of her anaesthesia she was noted to be tachycardic ranging from 80s-110s. She underwent a 1.5 hour surgery which was uneventful. In the PACU though her BP was noted to drop from 110s to 70s, though she was mentating well. BP was not fluid responsive and pt was started on Neo ar 0.3 and titrated up to a max of 0.8. Following IVF resuscitation 2.8L as well as 1u PRBC post-op (she received 2u PRBC prior to surgery) she was able to wean off pressors and have an increase in her urine output. For work-up of her hypotension she underwent [**Last Name (un) **] stim testing which was negative for adrenal insufficiency. . Her ICU course has also been notable for a diffuse morbilliform rash with palm and sole sparing. Dermatology were consulted for possible SJS. Given lack of mucosal involvement SJS was ruled out however Dermatology is still following the patient. The rash, which has steadily been improving, was thought to be due to Lamotrigine toxicity given her progressively poor Creatinine Clearance. Though interestingly enough unclear if Lamotrigine has dose adjustments based on renal clearance. . With regards to her diskitis, her blood cultures have thus far been negative and she is currently on Aztreonam and Vancomycin per ID recs. She is still being followed by Ortho who will take her to the OR tomorrow for posterior fusion, after which she will be able to participate in PT. . She is also being followed by Renal for her [**Last Name (un) **] which is thought to be AIN [**12-29**] Vancomycin toxicity. Renal are currently considering possible biopsy to confirm AIN. . On review of her vitals in the unit over the past few hours her Tmax has been 100.2, Tc 98.6, HRs 109-118, SBP 114-149/59-70, RR 24, 100% on RA. . ROS per HPI.

Otherwise normal colonoscopy to hepatic flexure of [**Month/Day/Year 499**]. No obvious bleeding source was noted. Recommendations: Return patient to floor Since the colonoscopy was aborted at the level of hepatic flexure, patient will need a colonoscopy as an outpatient.   Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT: 58 y.o. Female s/p distant gastric bypass complicated by recent hospitalization for leak s/p repair, sepsis initially admitted for LE weakness, hospitalization c/b diskitis s/p anterior fusion/debridement, ICU stay for hypotension on pressors now transferred to floor awaiting posterior fusion.  PLAN:  ## Diskitis: Pt was initially admitted for lower extremity weakness with mild weakness with the hip flexors, normal rectal tone. MRI work up was notable for L4-L5 disco-osteomyelitis. Unclear as to the source of her disco-osteomyelitis though given her recent discharge for sepsis it is possible that she seeded when she was bacteremic. Pt underwent debridement under OR and anterior fusion and later posterior fusion. Anterior fusion post-op course complicated by sepsis (discussed below). OR Swabs and multiple subsequent bld cultures have been negative. - Continued on Aztreonam and Vancoymcin per ID recs, switched from aztreonam to levofloxacin. Now on Levofloxacin PO Q24H, and vancomycin 1gm IV Q24H - post-op pain control: PCA switched to morphine contin 15mg PO Q12H, plus morphine 5-15mg PO Q6H PRN breakthrough pain (has had little pain med requirements, pain well controlled) - Ortho recommended PT - [**Name (NI) **] need a vanc trough drawn on [**2178-11-4**] and dose adjustement accordingly  ##. Rash: Pt noted to have diffuse rash over entire body with sparing of mucousal membranes, feet soles and palm. Dermatology followed and concluded this was due to lamictal, secondary to increased levels during ARF. Pt now noted to have lamictal allergy. -Held lamictal and rash resolved without signs of mucositis -Pt to continue triamcinolone cream for a total of 2 weeks (start date [**2178-10-23**])  ## Sepsis: Pt admitted to the unit for sepsis. Although resolved it is unclear as to the exact cause. Pt's hypotensive episode occured several hours after anterior fusion surgery so unlikely to be anaesthesia induced. Given requirement of pressors following surgery in an area complicated by infection hypotensive episode may be [**12-29**] transient bacteremia. Vanc and levo broadened to vanc and aztreonam. After several days, aztreonam switched back to levofloxacin. Bld cultures and swabs have thus far been negative. Sepsis resolved after less than 24 hours and pt has been off pressors since. - was continued on Aztreonam and Vancomycin per ID recs and later switched back to levofloxacin - To rehab facility: Pt has a f/u appointment at the [**Hospital **] clinic of [**Hospital6 1708**] with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD on [**2178-11-5**] 1000am. #: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 39041**]. They will decide the stop date of patient's antibiotics. . ## ARF: Unclear etiology. Creatinine peaked to 2.8 but eventually resolved now at 0.9. Per renal, ARF may have been due to vancomycin toxicity from too high dosing. (vanc level 80 at one point). No signs of uremia and no dialysis was employed. - To rehab facility: Please make sure to f/u vanc troughs every three days, as pt has unstable vancomycin pharmacokinetics  ## Guiac positive stool: Pt with guiac positive melena. Hct and hemodynamics remained stable. Pt underwent EGD which showed a large jejunal ulcer with stigmata of bleeding but no active bleeding. This may have been due to the stress from all the acute illnesses of osteo/discitis, sepsis, etc. No intervention done. Colonoscopy non-diagnostic due to poor prep. Hct stable. Pt continued on pantoprazole IV Q12H until GI follow determines when to discontinue.  ## Malnutrition: Pt malnourished with an albumin of 1.9 and INR of 1.4 secondary to vitamin K deficiency thought to be related to her severe illnesses during the last 2 months. Pt refusing TPN initially, calorie count initiated, only 200-300 calories per day, therefore, TPN initiated inhouse started [**2178-11-2**]. Patient also with K and Mg abnormalities. - To rehab facility: Please see Page 2 for nutrition recs. - To rehab facility: Please check daily K and Mg and replete lytes as necessary.

You had gastric bypass 4 years ago and a recent revision in [**2178-5-27**] that was complicated by intra-abdominal leakage and spinal abscess with osteomyelitis. During your hospital stay your surgery to debride the osteomyelitis was complicated by sepsis, which promptly resolved after IV fluids and IV antibiotics. You also developed kidney failure, possibly due to vancomycin toxicity (high serum levels at presentation) which also resolved over time. You developed a rash thought to be related to a lamictal allergy in the setting of increased reduced lamictal clearance given kidney failure. This too resolved with time. Also, you developed an ulcer which bled, and a scope showed that this ulcer remained stable. You will follow up with GI regarding the ulcer here at [**Hospital1 18**] and you will return to the [**Hospital **] clinic at [**Hospital1 112**], where they know you quite well.

Imaging:  Xray of right foot ([**9-19**]): IMPRESSION: 1. Erosive bony destructions at the first distal phalanx and at the stump of the second proximal phalanx consistent with osteomyelitis. 2. Severe degenerative changes in the tarsometatarsal joints and fracture at the 3rd metatarsal, suggesting early Charcot joint disease. 3. Significant small vessel disease.  2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**9-20**]):  The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-22**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-12-16**], the detected pulmonary hypertension has increased. There is no change in the left ventricular systolic function.  ETT: [**4-/2151**]: This 72 yo man with IDDM, mild AS s/p multiple cadiac interventions was referred to the lab for evaluation as a part of the Spinal Cord Stimulation study. The patient exercised for 2.5 minutes on a modified [**Doctor First Name **] protocol and stopped due a marked drop in systolic blood pressure. This represents a very limited exercise tolerance for his age. The patient denied any neck, chest, arm or back discomfort throughout the study. In the setting of baseline abnormalities, an additional 0.5mm of ST segment depression was noted in V4-V5 at peak exercise. These changes returned to baseline by minute 3 post-exercise. The rhythm was sinus with a single VPB in late recovery period. Marked drop in blood pressure with exercise (136/60mmHg at rest to 98/50mmHg at peak). Post-exercise hypertension was noted (172/60mmHg at 10 minutes of recovery). . IMPRESSION: Marked drop in blood pressure with exercise. Non-specific EKG changes without anginal type symptoms. . CARDIAC CATH: [**2147**]: COMMENTS: 1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant circulation revealed severe native three vessel disease. The LMCA had a 30% narrowing. The LAD had diffuse luminal irregularities and a 70% proximal stenosis. The mid vessel was diffusely diseased but the distal vessel filled via a patent LIMA->dLAD. The LAD supplied a large S2 that had an 80% lesion at its ostium. The LAD supplied two moderate sized diagonal branches which had diffuse luminal irregularities. The LCX tapered quickly and was totally occluded in the proximal vessel after a small OM branch. The RCA was diffusely diseased and totally occluded proximally. 2. Selective vein graft angiography revealed a widely patent SVG->dRCA and a widely patent SVG->D1/OM. 3. Selective arterial conduit arteriography demonstrated a widely patent LIMA->LAD. 4. Resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated right and left ventricular filling pressures with an LVEDP of 29 mmHg and a mean PCW pressure of 22 mmHg. In addition, there were V-waves to 50 mmHg  suggesting significant mitral regurgitation. There was evidence of moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension with PA pressures of 62/21/39 mmHg and a pulmonary vascular resistance of 209 dynes-sec/cm5. The cardiac output was preserved at 6.9 L/min. Note was made of a 10 mmHg gradient across the aortic valve. 5. Left ventriculography was not performed due to the patient's  underlying renal insufficiency and recent non-invasive testing documenting a preserved LV systolic function. . FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Severe native three vessel disease. 2. Patent LIMA->LAD. 3. Patent SVG->dRCA and SVG->D1/OM. 4. Moderate to severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. 5. Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.  CT head ([**9-24**]): IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial process. 2. Sequelae of chronic infarction involving the left parieto-occipital region.  Renal U/S ([**9-27**]): IMPRESSION:  Absent diastolic flow seen in the bilateral interlobar arteries of the kidneys. The findings are nonspecific, but indicate renal parenchymal disease. There is limited evaluation of the main renal arteries, but there is no clear evidence of renal artery stenosis. There is no hydronephrosis.  Brief Hospital Course: Summary: 74 yo M transferred from NWH with EKG changes, trop here to 0.87 (baseline 0.2) and RLE cellulitis, right foot osteomyelitis, worsening acute on chronic renal failure  # Right lower extremity cellulitis and right foot osteomyelitis: The patient presented with right lower extremity cellulitis and was found to have osteomyelitis in the right foot. Vascular surgery evaluated the patient and thought that treatment for the infection and ischemia would be a below the knee amputation, though given the patient's poor cardiac status, he would not be a good candidate for surgery. The patient was empirically started on Vancomycin and Zosyn. A wound culture grew Klebsiella oxytoca and MRSA and continued on those antibiotics. Since vascular surgery would be high risk, podiatry was consulted for local debridement. They debrided the area locally, yet erythema of the right foot existed. It remained unclear whether the erythema was due to ischemia vs. a subcutaneous abscess, so they recommended a MRI of the foot. The MRI was never performed because after discussion with the family and primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was decided for the patient to become CMO. His antibiotics were withdrawn and wound care applied to the area.  # Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient presented with a creatinine close to his baseline, however, after periods of hypotension, likely due to a peri-septic state, his creatinine starting to rise. He was given fluid boluses of 500 cc of normal saline as needed because his urine lytes showed a FeUrea~20-25%. Renal was consulted and thought his creatinine rise was likely due to acute tubular necrosis secondary to a pre-renal state. The patient was offered aluminium hydroxide for high phosphate levels, but the patient refused it. A renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis. The patient became progressively oliguric with UOP less than 20 cc/hour. Renal thought his kidneys would unlikely recover (his creatinine rose to 5.3 despite interventions). The patient and his family felt that they did not want to pursue dialysis as an option.  #Increased troponins: The patient was noted to have high troponins and excentuated ST wave depressions in V3-V5. Cardiology was consulted and recommended medical management with a beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, statin, and aspirin. The patient was started on these medications, though became persistently hyperkalemic, and therefore, the ACEi was discontinued. Also, his CK and LFTs were [**Last Name (LF) 28645**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the statin dose of 80 mg was lowered to 20 mg and eventually discontinued due to persistently [**First Name3 (LF) 28645**] LFTs. An echocardiogram revealed no acute wall motion abnormality, though it did show worsening tricuspid regurgitation and increased pulmonary artery pressure. Throughout his stay, the patient did not have any chest pain.  #Increased LFTs: The patient has a known history of alcohol abuse and increased LFTs in the past. During his peri-septic period, the patient was noted to have increased LFTs, likely multifactorial due to low perfusion to the liver and also congestion secondary to tricuspid regurgitation. The patient did not have any complaints of abdominal pain, though, he had hepatomegaly on exam.  #Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a history of a GI bleed and was guiaic positive in the ER. In addition, he had a persistently elevated PT/PTT, likely due to either underlying liver or hematologic disease. The patient's hematocrit remained stable until [**9-26**] when his hematocrit dropped from 29.0 to 25.6 and was noted to have melenic stools. He continued to have melenic stools, so he was transfused one unit of blood and transferred to the MICU. His aspirin was discontinued. His hematocrit remained stable in the MICU and transferred to the floors where there were no signs of any GI bleeding.  Altered mental status: The patient had periods where he had altered mental status, mostly at night. His AMS was likely multifactorial due to infection, pain and uremia. He had significant altered mental status on one day when he appeared more somnolent with respirations=10/min after a dose of Morphine 2mg IV. Narcane was given with some effect. A head CT showed no acute pathology. He continued to have periods of delirium mostly at night.  #Pruritis: The patient has been complaining of pruritis, especially on his back, since admission. A variety of remedies were tried for wound care. According to his son, the pruritis has been long-standing. It might be exacerbated by his renal failure. A side effect of Morphine is a possibility, but he still had the itching even before the morphine. He is being treated with skin care, sarna lotion, hydrocortisone and doxepin.  Goals of care: The patient entered the hospital as full code. After the renal and GI bleeding complications from his illness, the patient and his family decided to become DNR/DNI. After a meeting with the PCP and the family, they thought the best route would be to become comfort measures only instead of pursuing dialysis and being chronically cared for in a nursing home. At first, it was thought that his beta blocker, aspirin, and antibiotics would be continued, however, after further conversation, these medications were discontinued and only palliative measures for insomnia, anxiety, pain and constipation were ordered.

[**4-28**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is higher than expected for this type of prosthesis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. [Normal for this prosthesis.] The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. The gradient across the mitral valve is slightly increased (mean = 3-4 mmHg) resulting in trivial/minimal mitral stenosis. No mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Well seated mechanical aortic valve but with increased gradient. Well seated mitral annuloplasty ring with trivial mitral stenosis. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Dilated thoracic aorta. Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2144-12-25**], the aortic valve gradient is increased and minimal mitral stenosis is now identified. If clinically indicated, a TEE may be better able to define the cause of the increased gradient across the aortic valve. .

Moderate to severe diverticulosis in the entire colon. The terminal ileum was entered and the scope was advanced to the proximal/mid ileum. A few tiny red spots were seen. But there was no active bleeding. No AVM or mass lesions were seen. Otherwise normal small bowel enteroscopy to third part of the duodenum. . [**2156-4-29**] small bowel enteroscopy report: (from below) The examined proximal ileum was normal. No active bleeding or AVM or mass was seen.  Impression: Normal esophagus; A tiny nonbleeding erosion seen at the antrum; Mild and pathy erythema seen at duodenal bulb; Normal jejunum. No active bleeding or AVM or mass seen. Itattooed for marking; Normal proximal ileum. No active bleeding or AVM or mass seen. Otherwise normal small bowel enteroscopy to distal jejunum/proximal ileum.    Brief Hospital Course: REASON FOR ICU ADMISSION: Pt is a 69 y.o male with h.o CAD s/p CABG complicated by restenosis requiring multiple stents and recent NSTEMI, mechanical aortic valve on coumadin, recurrent GI bleeds and IDDM who was transferred from OSH with melena and CTA showing active bleeding in proximal ileum. . #upper GI bleed/acute blood loss/anemia-CTA per OSH report showed active bleeding in the proximal ileum. Pt with recent EGD with non-bleeding gastritis. Last colonoscopy 1 yr ago with polyps. UGIB in the setting of restarting plavix 1 week ago for NSTEMI. PT also on couamdin for mechanical valve, and started on heparin ggt as coumadin was held in setting of procedure. Hct remained stable. Pt was placed on a protonix gtt. Plavix was continued up until transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], then restarted. Discussed anticoagulation with patient's cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 32772**] who felt as though pt should be on heparin gtt as long as deemed safe from GI procedure prospective. Would prefer to restart ASAP after any procedure. In addition, outpt cardiologist felt as though pt should be on plavix unless there is presence of hemodynamically significant GI bleeding. He agreed that pt does not tolerate dual anti-platelet therapy (per pt, ASA caused bleeding). Enteroscopy was performed at [**Hospital1 18**] [**2156-4-29**] which showed no evidence of bleeding via approach from above. Small bowel enteroscopy/colonoscopy was performed [**2156-4-30**] which was similarly unremarkable. Pt was restarted on warfarin and heparin gtt. Pt went home [**2156-5-1**] on lovenox as bridge, with INR checks planned for [**2156-5-3**] and [**2156-5-5**]. . #CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: s/p CABG and PCI x2, severe CAD with chronic angina medically managed. Recent NSTEMI with decision to restart plavix after being held x2 years due to recurrent GI bleeds. At [**Hospital1 18**] plavix was held initially as GI team was uncomfortable doing procedure on plavix as interventions for bleeding (ex. clipping, cauterization could lead to more bleeding while on plavix). In addition, it was felt that at the time plavix effects would still be in his system as there was no complete washout period. As above, discussed case with pt's outpatient cardiologist who felt that pt would need to remain on plavix unless life hemodynamically significant GI bleeding. Pt was continued on imdur, statin, beta blocker held, see bradycardia below. He was ruled out for MI at OSH prior to transfer. He was monitored on tele. Without events. . # MECHANICAL AORTIC VALVE: placed at St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**]. Patient's goal INR 3.5 for  mechanical valve. Was switched to heparin which was stopped 6 hours prior to procedures. Given significant risk of thrombosis, heparin was restarted after procedures, despite patient's known GI bleed. HCT was monitored closely and remained stable. Heparin gtt was changed to lovenox on discharge, see above. . # Bradycardia: Patient noted to be bradycardic after procedure. Thought to be related to sedation for procedure. Improved as the patient woke up from sedation. Still, HR remained in the 50-60 range throughout hospitalization. Initially home beta blocker was held. Pt was monitored on telemetry without events. He was asymptomatic. Home atenolol restarted on discharge. . #DIABETES MELLITUS - type 2, with complications, peripheral neuropathy.  Placed on conservative insulin regimen while NPO. Pt resumed meformin and glyburide upon discharge. Continued gabapentin for neuropathy. . #HYPERTENSION - benign; initially held beta blocker in setting of bradycardia. Continued imdur. Held lisinopril while NPO. On the morning of discharge his blood pressure was elevated in the 170s systolic. We then restarted his home medications (atenolol, lisinopril) which we had been holding and felt these would be adequate for blood pressure control. . #DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE - chronic, but with recent acute exacerbation. Lasix was held while pt was NPO, and also was given with 1u pRBCs. . #hypothyroidism-continued synthroid . #HL-continued simvastatin . #GERD-on PPI ggt for c/f GI bleed as above, transitioned to PO PPI on discharge . #leukopenia/thrombocytopenia-unclear etiology. Could be due to acute process. Thrombocytopenia could be consumptive. PLT count was monitored closely and remained stable. . Pt was maintained as FULL CODE throughout the course of this hospitalization. . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: anticoagulation: pt sent home on warfarin (subtherapeutic after holding for procedures) and lovenox. He will need INR checked Monday [**2156-5-3**] and Wednesday [**2156-5-5**] likely to DC lovenox [**2156-5-5**] as ideally he would have a 48 hour therapeutic overlap. Pt was instructed to follow up with PCP regarding this issue.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.   Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 32776**],  You were admitted for further evaluation of gastrointestinal bleeding. For this, you had endoscopic procedures both from above and below the level of the stomach, both which were unrevealing for a source of bleeding.  This likely occurred in the presence of multiple blood thinners, causing leaking of a vessel which stopped once we held your blood thinners. We discussed the risks and benefits of being on blood thinners. Given your cardiac history, including stents and mechanical heart valves, it is necessary that your remain on warfarin and an antiplatelet [**Doctor Last Name 360**] (such as aspirin or clopidogrel AKA Plavix), to prevent a stroke and a heart attack respectively. You will be discharged on warfarin at your usual home dose as well as clopidogrel (Plavix).  Please note to follow up with your cardiologest within the week to assure you are on the most appropriate therapy for your cardiac health. As you know, your INR was below goal prior to discharge (goal 2.5-3.5), since we held your warfarin in the hospital so you could have procedures.  You will be going home on enoxaparin (AKA Lovenox)injections to keep your blood thin while your INR becomes therepeutic.  Medication changes: Please START taking Clopidogrel (AKA Plavix) 75mg po qday Please START taking Enoxaparin subcutaneous injections until your INR is therepeutic Please continue taking the rest of your medications as prescribed. . It has been a pleasure taking care of you Mr. [**Known lastname 32776**]!  Followup Instructions: Please arrange follow up with your primary care doctor and your cardiologist within 1 week of discharge.  You will need to have your INR on Monday [**2156-5-3**] and Wednesday [**2156-5-5**]. Speak to your primary care physician but you should stop lovenox on Wednesday [**2156-5-5**] if Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26652**] approves.

He was started empirically on Vancomycin and Zosyn for aspiration pneumonia.  Chest CT-A ruled out PE, as he was not on any DVT prophylaxis at the nursing facility.  Chest CT also showed bibasilar atelectasis vs consolidation. Patient was transitioned to azithromycin and transferred to floor when hemodynamically stable.  On the floor, he was restarted on Vancomycin and Zosyn for concern of aspiration pneumonia, re-evaluating bibasilar consolidations on Chest CT, likely secondary to chronic aspiration from tube feeds.  Pt was discharged bac kto the facility to continue IV antibiotics for a total of 7 days.  Pt was without fevers or leukocytosis at the time of discharge.  # History of Seizures: Patient was reported to have had seizure-like activity prior to presentation. Corrected Dilantin level was within therapeutic range. Pt was continued on seizure ppx, and had no clinically evident seizure activity. A 48 hr EEG was performed which showed no seizure activity, only epileptic interictal discharges, consistent with past stroke.  # Diabetes Mellitus: Patient was continued on home insulin regimen.  # Hypertension: Patient was continued on BB, Hydralazine and Lisinopril.  # Anemia: Is normocytic, likely secondary to chronic disease.

No apparent extrahepatic or intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation or irregularity is seen. No filling defects consistent with stones were noted. As per report, in subsequent images, biliary stent was successfully placed. IMPRESSION: Successful placement of biliary stent.  [**2175-8-9**] Transthoracic Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.  [**2175-8-14**] ERCP FINDINGS: Comparison is made with CT from [**8-12**], [**2174**] and prior ERCP from [**2175-8-8**].  There is removal of a plastic stent. A retrograde cholangiogram shows multiple filling defects, some of which likely represent stones, within otherwise normal- appearing biliary tree. A biliary stent was then placed.   Brief Hospital Course: #Hypotension/Sepsis: On admission, patient met SIRS criteria with fever, tachypnea, tachycardia and lactate of 2.5 consistent with sepsis. Infectious source was likely biliary tract vs. HD line infection, however also considered was pulmonary source w/ new O2 requirements although more likely from capillary leak/CHF. Patient has remained fluid responsive intially without need for pressors. The underlying infection was treated with IV vancomycin/unasyn/gentamycin for synergy until cultures at OSH grew enterobacter at which point only zosyn was continued with appropriate coverage. The patients lactate level, fevers and WBC were trended and returned to [**Location 213**]. Zosyn was switched to Ciprofloxacin after the patient developed a drug rash. . #Mechanical ventilation: Patient came to the ICU intubated s/p ERCP, on a propofol drip. Initially he was hypotensive which was treated with IV fluids and discontinued propofol, switching to fentanyl/versed for sedation.  Shortly thereafter the patient became restless, agitated and continued to be hypotensive. He was given 10mg vecuronium and paralyzed for arterial line placement and foley placement. His labile blood pressures also exacerbated his already fluid-overloaded state, making it difficult to wean off the vent. The initiation of hemodialysis effectively controlled his BP and fluid status, and on day 7, after his second ERCP, he was extubated and started on CPAP overnight. . # Gallstone Pancreatitis: On admission the patient had elevated LFTs, pancreatic enzymes, bilirubin and alk phos. His levels slowly trended down post-ERCP except bilirubin and AP, which continued to rise. The patient experienced intermittent epigastric discomfort which prompted a RUQ US, which showed a fatty liver but the common bile duct non-well visualised. CT scan of abdomen showed no intrahepatic biliary dilatation, cholelithiasis, and a subtle hypodensity in pancreatic head. Hepatology and ERCP were consulted prompting a second-look ERCP, which showed sludge drainage in the major papilla, stent migrated to major papilla and several stones in the cystic duct. The stent was replaced, antibiotics were continued, and the patient's enzymes and bilirubin were trended. . # ESRD: Initially the nephrology service felt HD was not appropriate early during admission, in setting of patient becoming hypertensive to 200s with volume resusitation for pancreatitis. Beta-blockers were started however the patient did not respond and O2 sats started trending down with worsening acidemia and low PaO2. The following day HD was initiated with good response in blood pressure. The patient received HD throughout his course, with the day before D/c the final time. . # Hypoxia: Suspected capillary leak in the setting of sepsis vs. CHF as pt with known CAD. The patient was weaned off his O2 requirement prior to discharge. . # Drug Rash: Patient developed a diffuse petticheal/macular rash on his chest and legs which was pruritic.  Dermatology was consulted who felt consistent with a drug rash.  Offending [**Doctor Last Name 360**] was felt to be Zosyn.  [**Doctor Last Name **] was discontinued and rash improved. He will continue hydoxyzine, sarna and fluocinonide. . # CAD: An echo was performed to rule out endocarditis as a cause of fever. This showed extensive calcification of cardiac skeleton, mild calcific aortic stenosis, and no definite vegetations . His ECG had some ischemic changes of unclear duration, and the patient had no active symptoms. Cardiac enzymes were stably elevated on admission and, in the setting of ESRD, this was unlikely to be acute event. His aspirin and plavix were continued and the patient remained on telemetry for the duration of his stay. . # OSA: Witnessed apneic episodes while asleep. Known history of OSA on CPAP as outpatient but has not been tolerating of recent. Once patient was extubated he was started on CPAP overnight. . # Anemia: Normocytic with normal RDW. Unclear baseline. [**Month (only) 116**] be low related to ESRD (not on epo as outpatient that we know of). D. bili not consistent with hemolysis. Hematocrit was trended and continued to improve with HD and management. Renal recs: use epo during HD. .

No acute cardiopulmonary pathology detected. 2. Mild widening of the superior mediastinum likely relates to the low lung volumes. If there is continued clinical concern for acute aortic injury, a CT of the chest can be performed.  CT Torso: 1. Non-displaced left fourth and sixth rib fractures, with associated ground-glass opacity in the left upper lobe adjacent to the fracture. This is non-specific and may represent contusion versus an area of inflammation. No pneumothorax or acute vascular injury detected. 2. No acute traumatic injury identified in the abdomen and pelvis. 3. No acute vascular injury detected in the right lower extremity runoff. 4. Extensive right lower extremity fractures, without evidence of vascular injury. Open comminuted right tibial and fibular fracture.   Brief Hospital Course: Pt was seen and resuscitated in the trauma bay. His primary survey was unremarkable and secondary survey revealed a nearly amputated RLE at the level of the ankle/mid tibia, as well as two lacerations on the LUE, each approx 5-6cm. Orthopedics and Plastic Surgery were consulted to the trauma bay for management of these two injuries respectively. He required one unit pRBCs during his resuscitation. The patient did still have a dopplerable pulse in the RLE, and was taken immediately to the OR for preliminary stabilization of the associated fractures in an attempt to salvage this extremity. His forearm lacerations were repaired concurrently.  The patient was followed for these injuries and admitted to the trauma service for management. He was progressing well with an open right tib fib injury that had already been stabilized, but continued to have unstable hematocrits, requiring multiple additional transfusions. No source outside of the RLE could be identified, so the bleeding was assumed to be from his lower extremity injuries.  During the patients recovery on the floor he developed acute mental status changes . A head CT was obtained with no acute changes. He was given Haldol for agitation and acutely developed fever to 103F. A diagnosis of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome was presumed and he was transferred to the SICU for management. He was also noted with high urine output and hypernatremia; of note he has a history of bipolar disorder and has been on lithium. Psychiatry became involved and his Lithium and other psychiatric meds were withheld. His Na did normalize and was 141 at time of discharge. His psychiatric meds were recommended to be slowed restarted. All of his other potentially offending medications were held and he was followed in the ICU until his fevers resolved and his mental status improved.  Following this, the patient was transferred to the floor for further management. He was evaluated by Psychiatry for recommendations regarding his home psych meds and they were resumed at lower doses in order to assess his response. At time of this dictation he is tolerating these initial doses and should be increased to his home dose once continued stabilized while at rehab.  He did have significant pain control issues requiring initially higher doses of his narcotics. He was started on Methadone 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] to manage his acute pain issues and is also receiving Dilaudid po prn for breakthrough pain.  He was evaluated by Physical therapy and is being recommended for rehab after his acute hospital stay.  Medications on Admission: Lithium Percocet  Discharge Medications: 1.

MICROBIOLOGY Urine cx (-) x3.  Blood cx x2 negative at time of d/c.  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 69 yo Cantonse speaking female who presented with letargy, gait abnormality and a serum sodium of 104. In ED she was found to have obstructive uropathy resolving with foley placement. Of note she has been of HCTZ/Triamtrene for number of years as treatment of her HTN.  1. Hyponatremia: Pt with profound hyponatremia thought likely secondary to her diuretic use. In the ED she appeared dry on exam.  The patient had an initial FeNa of 4.91 and a urine Na of 26 which was consistent with renal losses and inconsistent with SIADH.  In the ED she received one liter of normal saline and her sodium increased from the nadir of 104 to 121 by the time of arrival to the ICU.  She was not given any more saline at that time, and her sodium was monitored while tolerating a regular diet. It slowly increased to 127, she was noted to have global hyporeflexia but no other neurological deficits at time of transfer to the floors.   Pt was monitored and all IVFs were held, as her sodium level slowly increased to normal on HD#5. It was thought that her neurogenic bladder caused a decrease in GFR, and a build of thiazide diuretic which led to her severe hyponatremia.  Once a Foley was placed in the [**Name (NI) **], pt was able to urinate and auto-correct, and her sodium drifted to normal with minimal intervention.  No neurologic sequelae was seen due to the correction of her sodium during this admission.  Pt was instructed at discharge to never restart her thiazide diuretic as this alone may have precipitated her severe hyponatremia. . 2. Urine outflow obstruction: It remained unclear what caused her initial neurogenic bladder and bladder residual of 1700cc at time of admission.  It was thought that perhaps a medication effect, whether OTC medication or anticholinergic benadryl in cough syrup, that perhaps contributed to her neurogenic bladder.  Pt was attempted multiple voiding trials on HD#5 and HD#7 but each time patient had PVR of >700cc, and the Foley was reinserted.  Urology was consulted who recommended leaving the Foley in place for 1 week after discharge, and to f/u with urology in 1 week for voiding trial at that time.  A spinal MRI perfomed at this admission did not show mass or any cord compression that would lead to urinary retention. . 3. Cough: She developed a productive cough with mild hemoptysis at time of transfer to the floors, this was associated with a fever of 101 the night prior. She was therefore contained on precautions and ruled out for TB, although with no history of TB and no evidence of opacities on chest xray . 4. Renal Failure: ARF on admission with Cr 1.8 due to obstructive uropathy, resolved with Foley placement, returning to 0.9 on discharge. Renal u/s with R>L hydro appears to be resolving. . 5. HTN: normotensive on presentation to the ED. Pt's previous cardizem and dyazide were stopped, and patient was started on Metoprolol for BP control.  Pt was instructed to never restart her dyazide diuretic. . DISPO: Spoke to PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].

Unit No:   [**Numeric Identifier 11193**]  Admission Date:  [**2122-4-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-8-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-12-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Penicillins / Benzocaine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2648**] Addendum: He remained in hospital after discovering that liver abscesses grew sparse mucor. ID recommended posoconazole in addition to ambisone. This was started and he continued on this for the remainder of hospital course. The decision was made to keep him hospitalized until re-transplanted. Psychiatry was consulted for depression. Dextroamphetamine was recommended as first choice with zoloft being an alternative [**Doctor Last Name 932**]. Zoloft was started and dose increase during remainder of hospital stay with some improvement in mood. 2 units of PRBC were given for a hct of 22 on [**6-4**]. Epogen was continued. On [**6-5**] an abd ct revealed mod ascites for which hepatology was consulted. A paracentesis was performed. He was cultured for a temp of 101.7 on [**6-7**] for which the c-line was changed. The tip was neg for growth as well as urine and blood. On [**6-9**] he grew gram +cocci (VRE-enterococcus faecium)only sensitive to linezolid. Given past h/o myelosuppression, he was started on Tigecycline. Tigecycline continued for 16 days. He spiked a temp on [**6-12**] and again the c-line was changed over a wire. A rpt ABD CT revealed two fluid collections within the left and right lobes of the liver. The collection within the right lobe of the liver appeared to have increased in size, measuring 5.6 x 4.1 cm. The left liver lobe collection was essentially unchanged. Bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the left, were decreased slightly and a large amount of ascites, which was decreased slightly. There was evidence of peritoneal enhancement. The fluid extended into the inguinal canals, and was loculated on the right side. Ceftriaxone which was used for E.coli was stopped after 18 days and  Meropenum was started for E.coli & Strep veridins to broaden coverage. Dapto was stopped. He remained on meromenum for 38 days. He continued to spike temps. Repeat paracentesis was done on [**6-15**]. Cultures were negative. On [**6-18**], he was removed from the Transplant list given multidrug resistant multifocal liver abscesses, poor nutritional status despite J tube feedings, debilitation and poor prior outcomes in other patients with similar setting. On [**6-16**] blood cultures grew yeast. Ambisone was started [**6-19**]. Repeat blood and drain cultures were sent. A TTE was done to r/o vegetations. This was negative. An Ophthalmology exam was negative as well. On [**6-23**] a repeat abd CT revealed two large fluid collections within the left and right lobes of the liver. The left lobe fluid collection had decreased in size, whereas the right lobe fluid collection had increased in size. A large well circumscribed fluid collection extending down the right inguinal canal into the right scrotum was seen. A head CT was done to r/o infection. This was negative. On [**6-24**] an 8 Fr catheter was repostitioned in RLQ. Culure of the fluid grew ENTEROCOCCUS SP,CITROBACTER FREUNDII COMPLEX. SPARSE GROWTH, NON-FERMENTER, NOT PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA. [**Female First Name (un) **] (TORULOPSIS) GLABRATA.MODERATE GROWTH and CITROBACTER FREUNDII COMPLEX. Blood cultures from [**6-23**] continued to grow yeast and VRE. Blood cultures were done q 3 days.  On [**7-1**] CT findings showed new area of decreased enhancement in segment [**Doctor First Name **] of the liver, worrisome for a new area of ischemia/infarction. Internal air bubbles were present, and superinfection of this area could not be excluded. The area did not appear to have adequate liquification for percutaneous catheter drainage. Two collections in left lobe of the liver had appropriately positioned drainage catheters appeared slightly smaller and a collection in right lobe of the liver, which contained an appropriately positioned catheter was unchanged in size. On [**6-30**] Dapto was restarted as well as gentamycin for synergy to attempt to clear VRE. Ambisone was changed to Caspo on [**7-3**]. On [**7-7**],the catheter in right lobe of liver was advanced several centimeters with aspiration of approximately 20 cc of purulent material. This appeared in continuity with multiple bilomas/dilated ducts, which were slightly more prominent than on the previous study. ID recommended a TTE to r/o vegetation, but the patient refused TTE. Synercid was started perioperatively for VRE coverage. On [**7-17**] he was taken to the OR for irrigation and debridement of hepatic abscess, right lobe by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. 40-50cc of purulent, bile stained drainage was removed. A large drain was left in place and placed to suction. He tolerated this procedure well. Blood cultures and cline tip on [**7-7**] were negative. Cultures were negative until [**7-14**]. He was relisted for liver transplantation. Subsequent cultures grew  enterococcus faeceum. Repeat cultures were negative, but then reculture grew enterococcus faeceum and presumed torulopsis glabrata (per ID).Levaquin was added for additional gram negative coverage. Repeat Abd CT showed interval placement of JP drain into the right lobe of the liver with associated focal subcutaneous air/surgical emphysema. Air containing abscess in the right lobe superior to this appeared to have increased in size. Splenomegaly and ascites were again noted. On [**7-21**], he underwent successful CT-guided pigtail cath placement in enlarging fluid collection at the junction of segments 8 and 4A.  On [**7-29**] abd CT revealed 1) S/p multiple drains. Confluent biloma/abscess involving segment [**Doctor First Name **] and VIII of the liver, the component in the right lobe is smaller compared to the CT of [**2122-7-21**]. 2) Small bilateral pleural effusions. 3) Persisting ascites, predominantly left-sided and partially loculated. 4) Nonvisualized proper hepatic artery, likely occluded. Partial SMV occlusion. 5) Prominent right-sided hydrocele. 6) Splenomegaly. Abscess cultures persistently grew VRE and [**Female First Name (un) **] (TORULOPSIS) GLABRATA. P. On [**7-31**]  Caspofungin and meropenum was stopped. The 2 drains in the left lobe were removed. A repeat CT on [**8-3**] revealed collection in left lobe and a drain was placed into this site and 10cc was sent for culture. Results are pending. On [**8-6**] the capped PTC drain fell out with no adverse effects. Developed diarrhea after tube feed formula changed. Stool was sent for c.diff. Stool neg on [**8-5**] and pending for [**8-6**] On [**8-14**] the right liver abscess catheter fell out. This area was then loosely packed with normal saline moist gauze [**Hospital1 **]. Potassium was consistently running high. A renal consult was obtained. Bactrim and synercid were felt to be contributing to hyperkalemia. Bactrim SS was decreased to 3x/week and the tube feeding was changed back to 1/2 strength Nepro. Potassium decreased within the normal range. In summary, this hospital course was extremely long and complicated. He has remained afebrile for last few weeks. Posoconazole, Levaquin, Synercid will continue. Rifaximin is to prevent encephalopathy. Bactrim is for pcp [**Name Initial (PRE) 2515**]. The plan is to send [**Doctor First Name **] to [**Hospital **] Rehab Hospital with the hope of building him up nutritionally and increasing his physical strength and independence with the hope of keeping him afebrile while awaiting re-transplantation of a second liver.  He will be followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (Transplant Surgeon) and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 25**] (ID).

A left lung is grossly clear. There is no evident pneumothorax. Right lung peripheral opacities better evaluated in prior CT [**8-5**] and are unchanged.  [**2154-8-31**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP) There has been markedly improved in right upper, right perihilar and right lower lobe opacities consistent with improving hemorrhage or aspiration. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly. There is no evident pneumothorax. Of note, the lateral aspect of the left hemithorax was not included on the film. There are no increasing right pleural effusions. Sternal wires are aligned with fracture of the first wire.  [**2154-8-30**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP) FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal tube has been removed. The diffuse area of opacification involving the perihilar region extending into both the apical and lower zone on the right is again seen. Again, this could well represent post-procedure hemorrhage, though supervening pneumonia cannot be excluded.  [**2154-8-30**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP) IMPRESSIONS: Extensive right central and upper lung airspace opacity, which may reflect hemorrhage from the recent procedure, or asymmetric pulmonary edema.  [**2154-8-30**] Pathology Tissue: Tracheal tumor Distal ,   [**2154-8-30**] [**Last Name (LF) 829**],[**First Name3 (LF) 828**] C. Not Finalized   Brief Hospital Course: # Apnea/Hypoxia: The patient experienced apnea in the immediate post-operative period following debridement of a tracheal nodule. The apnea was thought to be attributed to paralytics, which warranted intubation. When the paralytic agents wore off, the patient was extubated, but remained hypoxia. The prolonged hypoxia post-operatively was attributed to aspiration pneumonitis likely with an element of post-operative inflammation from the procedure itself. The patient remained rhoncorous with course upper airway breath sounds throughout the hospitalization. CXR ruled out PNA as a potentialy source of hypoxia, and the patient did not produce significant volumes of concentration of blood in the sputum concerning for tracheal bleed. Other possibilities include worsening of underlying lung cancer which is unlikely to explain acute hypoxia. The patient was eventually transitioned to high flow face mask, followed by high-flow face tent, followed by nasal cannular on 4L. The patient was weaned without event from 4L to 2L nasal cannula and transferred to the inpatient medical floor, where she continued sat'ing ~94% on 2L. Nebs were administered on an as needed basis throughout the duration of hospitalization, and were found to be helpful in terms of coughing up phlegm.  The patient was taken off supplemental oxygen the following day and sat'ed within her normal baseline range 88-92% on room air without any problems at rest. However, patient desaturated with physical therapy during activity. They recommended home oxygen (2L with activity)when ambulating with a walker. The patient will be discharged with home oxygen as well as VNA services. . # Hct Drop: The patient presented with a Hct 44.7 and found to have a Hct of 33.1 post-operatively. The low Hct is most likely attributable to fluids received during procedure and minimal blood loss, however given the 12 point drop, her lab values were followed and the Hct level was stable and began to rise without event or concern for chonic blood loss. Hct 34.0->35.8 this AM. . # Non-Small Cell Lung CA: A new tracheal mass identified on CT in [**Month (only) **] was highly concerning for metastasis and likely to grow to occlude airway the airway, so surgical debridement was warranted with interventional pulmonology without intraoperative complications outside of apnea/hypoxia as elaborated on above. The patient is now POD#2 s/p debridment by IP. Biopsy results are pending. She is followed by interventional pulmonology for continued management. . # Goals of Care: Discussed code status with patient, daughter and sons. [**Name (NI) **] quite clearly does not desire intubation or heroic measures. Daughter is having a difficult time with this but understands and respects her mother's wishes. The DNR/DNI status was confirmed with the patient and her health care proxy.  . # IDDM: Continued home glargine and home meds. . # HTN: Continued amlodipine, lopressor and ASA. . # Hyperlipidemia: Continued home statin.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane) and supplemental oxygen.   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the [**Hospital 18**] hospital for surgical debridement of a tracheal nodule that was contributing to your difficulty breathing. You underwent this procedure with the interventional pulmonologists.  After surgery you were found to have difficulty breathing and decreased oxygen levels that were thought to be a result of both the paralytic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] used during surgery as well as the possibility that you aspirated fluids into your trachea/lungs during surgery. As such, you were intubated and transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for respiratory care and support.  In the MICU, your blood oxygen levels improved over the course of a day on supplemental oxygen and you were transitioned from a face-mask to a face-tent to a nasal cannula on supplementary oxygen. When your oxygen levels stabilized, you were transferred to the inpatient floor, where you were eventually weaned off of supplementary oxygen. You were breathing stable at your baseline blood oxygen levels on the inpatient floor at rest, but were found to be significantly short of breath with activity. As such, physical therapy has recommended home oxygen, as well as instructed you to walk with a walker.  We have set up visiting nursing to assist you with your home oxygen, as well as evaluating you for home safety and continued physical therapy.  The following changes were made to your at-home medications: 1) Added Home oxygen. 2) Added Albuterol-Ipratropium inhaler. Please take 1-2 PUFFs every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing. No other changes were made to your at-home medications. Please continue taking them as instructed. 3) Decreased your metoprolol to 50 mg twice a day from 150 mg  Followup Instructions: Please follow-up with your primary care physician 7-10 days following discharge.

After falling, he developed left sided rib pain (later found to be due to rib fracture), and sought care at the local ED, where he was told to take tylenol. After continuing to have pain for several more days he returned to the ED and was prescribed motrin for the rib pain. He reports taking 600mg every 4-5 hrs for 3-4 days. He also reports having very diminished appetite and eating and drinking very little during this time. Three days PTA, he developed SOB. At the urging of his children, he flew back from FL to be seen here in [**Location (un) 86**]. In addition to decreased PO intake, he reported insomnia and nausea/dry heaves.  He denied abdominal pain, fevers, chills, sick contacts, or travel out of the country. . On admission, EKG showed right heart strain and possible lateral ischemic changes.  Pulmonary embolism was considered; V/Q scan was read as low probability. Acute coronary syndrome was also considered, and cardiac enzymes were elevated with troponin 0.12 and MB index 14.8. Heparin gtt was started, along with ASA and beta blocker. Also on admission, he was found to have lactic acidosis in setting of ARF (creatinine 3.4 with baseline 1.1) with serum lactate 3.9 --> 6.7 and Anion Gap of 25.  Serum potassium was 6.0 and bicarb 12. He was given bicarb gtt for acidosis and kayexelate, insulin and glucose for elevated K. . Initial temp was 94.4 and CXR showed vague opacity in RML. Blood cultures were drawn and levo/vanc started.  In the ED, patient has 2 transient episodes of hypotension which resolved spontaneously.  He was admitted to the MICU.

V/Q scan [**2143-1-7**] INTERPRETATION: Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in 8 views demonstrate very heterogenous ventilation with numerous subsegmental defects bilaterally. Perfusion images in the same 8 views show numerous small bilateral non-segmental defects. These defects are in the same areas as the ventilation defects, but are less prominent. The AP dimension is enlarged, and the diaphgrams are flattened. The chest x-ray is clear. The above findings are consistent with a low probability for pulmonary embolism, but are consistent with COPD. . #. TTE [**2143-1-8**] Conclusions: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function. Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis and moderate-severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension c/w a primary pulmonary process. . #. ECG [**2143-1-9**] Sinus rhythm, right ventricular hypertrophy, Diffuse ST-T wave changes with borderline prolonged/upper limits of normal Q-Tc interval - could be due in part to right ventricular hypertrophy but clinical correlation is suggested Since previous tracing of [**2143-1-8**], further ST-T wave changes present and Q-Tc interval appears short. . #. CT chest with Contrast [**2143-1-9**] IMPRESSION: 1. Right loculated collection which has high CT attenuation value and may represent either empyema or hemorrhage within pleural effusion. 2. Right lower lobe opacity with bronchial wall thickening which may represent pneumonia/aspiration. 3. Right basilar atelectasis. 4. Small left pleural effusion. 5. Ground-glass opacity in the right apex. This should be followed up with a CT in three months. 6. Focal ground-glass opacity in the right middle lobe and right lower lobe may represent infectious/inflammatory etiology. This could also be followed up on the CT which will be obtained in three months. 7. Atherosclerotic coronary calcifications. 8. Gallstones without evidence of cholecystitis. 9. Liver granulomas. . #. Renal US [**2143-1-10**]: FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 9 cm in length, previously measuring 9.5 cm. The left kidney measures 10.2 cm in length, previously measuring 10.7 cm in length. In the interpolar region of the right kidney, there is an area with lobulated appearance consistent with cortical scarring, unchanged from the prior study. In the interpolar region of the left kidney, there is a tiny cortical crystal. There is no hydronephrosis, stones, or renal masses. There is no perirenal fluid. The bladder is unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. Slight interval decrease in size in both kidneys. 2. There is no hydronephrosis. 3. Stable area of cortical scarring in the right kidney. . #. TEE [**2143-1-15**] Conclusions: 1. The left atrium is dilated. 2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is difficult to assess but is probably normal. 3. There are complex (>4mm) sessile atheroma in the aortic arch.  There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. 6. There is a small pericardial effusion. 7. No evidence of endocarditis seen. . #. CTA Chest [**2143-1-16**]: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. Unchanged right loculated collection within the pleural space of hyperattenuation. Given the appearance with increased subpleural fat, this has the appearance of chronic right effusion. It is difficult to comment on possible thickening of the pleura. 3. Small left simple effusion, slightly increased from the prior study. 4. 3-mm nodule in the right middle lobe. In the absence of known malignancy, one-year CT followup could be considered. 5. Atherosclerotic coronary artery calcifications. 6. Cirrhosis of the liver, with low-attenuation oval lesion near the dome. It is incompletely characterized on the study. 7. Gallstones without evidence of cholecystitis. 8. Left lateral fifth and seventh rib fractures. 9. Cystic structure above the manubrial notch without enhancement, incompletely characterized on this study. . #. Core biopsy of R solid pleural effusion [**2143-1-17**] . #. Stress test [**2143-1-21**] Exercising stress test: No anginal symptoms or ECG changes from baseline. N Persantine MIBI: Left ventricular cavity size is normal. Resting and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the myocardium. Gated images reveal normal wall motion. The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 71%. No prior studies are available for comparison. IMPRESSION: Normal myocardial perfusion. EF 71%.   Brief Hospital Course: #. Anion Gap Acidosis: Was likely due to lactic acidosis given his high lactate on admission. High lactate production likely occurred [**1-17**] sepsis and poor perfusion, and ARF prevented clearance of lactate. Was treated with bicarb in the ED and Gap resolved. . #. Hyperkalemia: resolved after receiving kayexelate, insulin and glucose in ED. . #. RV strain/Pulmonary Hypertension: On [**1-8**] TTE was obtained and showed a dilated RV with severe global free wall hypokinesis and abnormal septal movement. He was also noted to have moderate-severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension consistent with a primary pulmonary process.  LVEF was >55%. Elevated tropinins measured in the ED were thought to be due to RV strain combined with decreased renal clearance. By [**1-9**], troponin had trended down and heparin gtt was discontinued. For his pulmonary hypertension observed on echo, a pulmonary consult was obtained. Acute PE was thought to be an unlikely cause of his echo findings given the negative V/Q scan on admission, but chronic PE was thought to be a possibility. CTA was obtained on [**1-16**], which was negative. Other etiologies were considered, including porto-pulmonary hypertension from cirrhosis. HIV, [**Doctor First Name **] and RF were sent and found to be negative. Scleroderma antibody test is pending. He will undergo an outpatient work-up for pulmonary hypertension with PFTs, sleep study, and outpatient appointment with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. . #. Hypoxia: The patient was dyspneic on admission, and was maintained on supplemental oxygen for oxygen saturations that dropped into the high 80's at rest on room air. This was thought to be related to a presumed RML pneumonia (seen as opacity on admission CXR) and underlying pulmonary hypertension seen on Echo. However, the opacity observed on CXR was not seen on CT from [**1-16**], so it is unlikely that the original opacity represented a pneumonia as originally thought. His dyspnea slowly improved, and he was weaned from supplemental oxygen by [**1-14**]. However, on [**1-15**] he again developed an oxygen requirement after IV fluids were initiated in preparation for receiving IV contrast, and on [**1-16**], resting oxygen saturation was measured at 89% on room air at rest, 85% while ambulating. CTA [**1-16**] showed an enlarged left-sided pleural effusion (fluid density) and a R-sided pleural effusion that was determined to be solid on thorocentesis (Path result is pending). These findings, in combination with his pulmonary hypertension and deconditioning were thought to account for the patient's continued hypoxia. Diuresis was initiated the following day, and satrurations improved, but he continued to have an oxygen requirement. He had also been noted to have worsened dyspnea while ambulating, and a stress test was performed to rule-out an anginal component. Stress test was normal, showing no ECG changes or anginal component and normal myocardial perfusion with Ejection Fraction of 71%. By discharge, oxygen saturations were 98% on 3L, and he was discharged home on 2L oxygen via nasal cannula. . #. Acute Renal Failure: On admission, the patient had a creatinine level of 3.4. This appeared to be related to a prerenal state, as supported by his history of very poor PO intake x 10 days and FENa<1%. The possibility of ATN from NSAIDs was also considered given his recent history of taking Motrin for pain, and renal followed the patient until Cr had improved. Renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis. Creatinine slowly improved with IVF and time, and had decreased to 1.2 by [**1-16**] (most recent baseline measurement was 1.1 in [**2140**]). When the patient's home diuretics were subsequently restarted for hyponatremia and fluid overload, Cr rose again to 1.6. By discharge, the patient's creatinine was 1.4. . #. Staph Bacteremia: Blood cultures on admission grew MSSA (4/4 bottles from [**1-7**]). Renally-dosed vancomycin was started on [**1-8**], then switched to oxacillin on [**1-10**] when sensitivities returned. 2/2 blood cultures from [**1-10**] also grew staph aureus. Surveillance cultures since then have been negative. TEE done [**1-15**] not show any valvular abnormalities. A PICC line was placed on [**1-12**] and the patient completed a 14-day course of IV antibiotics on [**2143-1-22**] and the PICC was removed prior to discharge. . #. Hyponatremia: While in the ICU, the patient had one set of serum chemistries with serum sodium of 122. Remainder of values were in 130s until fluids were started on [**1-14**] in preparation for CTA with dye load. Next measured Na was 127 on [**1-16**]. He was fluid restricted to 1500cc/day and encouraged to improve his food intake, which had been poor throughout his admission. Given that he also had evidence of total body fluid overload (peripheral and abdominal edema), he was restarted on his home diuretic regimen of Lasix 20mg and spironolactone 25mg. By [**1-22**], Na had risen to 131. . #. UTI: Urine labs from [**1-9**] showed UTI, for which the patient was treated with a 7 day course of Levofloxacin that finished on [**1-16**]. Urine Cx was negative, but was sent after the patient had started Levofloxacin and Vancomycin. Fever curve remained flat. . #. Anxiety: The patient consistently reported having a ""nervous stomach"" that felt like it had ""knots in it."" He has had these sensations for many years, and reported that it made eating difficult because it caused him to feel nauseus. This was thought to be a manifestation of anxiety, and the patient was tried on 0.5mg of Ativan. This was subsequently discontinued when he was found to be excessively somnolent. The patient agreed to start Remeron for help with anxiety and appetite stimulation. He tolerated it well and was discharged on 15mg Remeron QHS. . #. DM: The patient recived QID finger sticks and was treated with bedtime glargine and ISS. Blood glucose measurments fluxuated with his PO intake and adjustments were made as appropriate. . #. Hypertension/ CAD: The patient was treated with ASA 325mg and Metoprolol 12.5mg TID. As the patient had no apparent indication for digoxin, this was held during his hospitalization. He was discharged on atenolol 12.5mg daily and ASA 325mg daily. Stress test revealed no hypoperfusion at rest or with persantine stimulation. . #. Nutrition: Albumin was 2.6 on admission, 2.4 on [**1-16**]. The patient reported a 10 day history of anorexia on admission and continued to have poor PO intake throughout most of his hospitalization. He cited lack of appetite and nausea caused by his ""nervous stomach"" as reasons for his poor intake. The patient was maintained on a renal diet with liquid supplements (Boost) TID. He had poor compliance until 2 days prior to discharge, when he reported an increase in appetite and improved PO intake was recorded. . #. Hemochromatosis/cirrhosis: Remained stable during this hospitalization. . #. Hypothyroidism: Remained stable. He was treated with his home dose of Levothyroxine 100 mcg daily during this admission. . # Physical Therapy: The patient was evaluated and followed by PT, who felt he was safe to return to his daugter's home. . # Prophylaxis: The patient was treated with incentive spirometry, H2 blocker, and SC heparin (which was discontinued when he began ambulating) . #. Abnormal tests requiring outpatient follow-up: Seen on CTA [**2143-1-16**]: 1. 3mm pulmonary nodule in the right middle lobe. 2. hypodense oval lesion approx 8mm at the liver dome. Recommend follow-up CT in 1 year.

History of Present Illness: This patient had undergone a series of bouts of intestinal obstruction.  This last time she was in fact given an upper GI series and small bowel follow through and when she came to the hospital, she had some barium and a nest of bowel in the pelvis. It was not clear exactly what the cause of obstruction was but she did not pass much gas nor was she able to get rid of her nasogastric tube. The colostomy was prolapsed and it appeared on CT scan that she had an area of a kink in the small bowel which was a transitional point. This in fact was the case but it was also a place where she was obstructed with barium.

On CT scan she had an area of twisted bowel along with her large parastomal hernia.  Her ostomy output had no stool or gas in it.  She was taken to the OR to resolve these issues.  In the OR she had a large amount of barium in the small intestine which was moved into the cecum.  She had a hyperkalemia directly following surgery which resolved with an insulin drip.  She was admitted to the ICU for this purpose. Her blood sugars were difficult to control post-operatively and she was maintained on the insulin drip for the first 3 days post-operatively.  It was also difficult to ween her from her O2 needs post-op (this was most likely due to her very long smoking history).  Eventually she was restarted on her home metformin and was able to come off of oxygen therapy.  On day 3 post-operatively gas and stool appeared at her ostomy following a bowel regimen of colace and mineral oil.  She was discharged home to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] in clinic.  She was tolerating PO intake at discharge and was in good condition.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Ovarian cancer.  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was admitted for with symptoms of bloating.  The patient's workup revealed a large pelvic mass that was suspicious for ovarian cancer.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for migraines.  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Noncontributory.   PAST OBSTETRICAL HISTORY:  Noncontributory.  HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for an exploratory laparotomy, TAH/BSO, peritoneal washings, omentectomy, and debulking, and pelvic lymph node dissection.  The estimated blood loss of the procedure was 250 cc. The procedure was uncomplicated.  The patient's postoperative course was complicated by an episode of respiratory arrest believed to be related to narcotic sensitivity.  The patient had received in total 3 mg of morphine IV and 4 mg of Dilaudid IV and then 4 mg of Dilaudid subcutaneously.  A code was called.  The patient's airway was immediately secured and she was immediately bagged.  Narcan was given IV and the patient responded well with a vigorous respiratory effort.  The patient was transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring and at that time was started on a Narcan drip.  The patient did well for the remainder of the night and the Narcan drip was then discontinued in the early morning.  The patient's pain control overnight was managed with a dose of p.o. Percocet early in the morning.  The patient was called out of the MICU on postoperative day number one and transferred to the regular Postsurgical Floor. The patient's pain control was initially controlled with Percocet and then transitioned to Toradol and then finally after a consultation with the Pain Service was transitioned to Flexeril 10 mg t.i.d. and Motrin 600 mg q. six hours.  In addition, Physical Therapy consult was obtained to provide assistance with the patient in ambulation and mobility.  The patient's urine output was adequate throughout her hospitalization/postoperative course.  She began tolerating p.o. on postoperative day number one.  On postoperative day number one, she also began ambulating.  The patient's Foley was discontinued and she was voiding spontaneously.  Her vital signs remained stable for the remainder of the hospitalization.  Her abdominal examination had positive bowel sounds and was appropriately tender.  Her incision remained clean, dry, and intact.  The patient will be discharged to home on a full diet with Flexeril 10 mg t.i.d. and 600 mg of Motrin q. six hours, simethicone 80 mg q. eight hours.

[**2132-8-4**] Chest X ray IMPRESSION: Unchanged left mid lung field opacity concerning for pneumonia.  [**2132-8-3**] CTA CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no pulmonary embolism. The pulmonary arterial vasculature is patent to the segmental level. The aorta demonstrates no acute pathology. The remaining great mediastinal vessels are unremarkable. The heart is normal in size without pericardial effusions. Moderate coronary calcifications are again noted. Small mediastinal lymph nodes are not pathologically enlarged, compatible with the underlying pneumonia. There is no definitive hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy. Again noted are severe emphysematous changes of the lung parenchyma, with upper lobe predominance and also parasagittal bulla in the anterior lungs.  There is interval increase of honeycombing opacity in the left upper lobe, with persistent left lower lobe consolidation, compatible with worsening infectious process in the left lung. The right lung base opacification from prior pneumonia appears to decrease in size. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The central tracheobronchial tree remains patent. The study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis. An abdominal aortic aneurysm is not adequately assessed in the current study, measuring up to 30 mm in diameter (image 3:127). BONE WINDOW: Multilevel degenerative changes are mild to moderate. Left-lateral spinal fusion rod is unchanged in position. Mild-to-moderate loss of vertebral heights are again noted. There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. IMPRESSION: 1. Interval worsening of left-sided multifocal pneumonia. Near-resolution of right lower lobe pneumonia. 2. No PE or acute aortic dissection. Incidental note of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. 3. Unchanged severe centrilobular emphysema.  Lower extremity ultrasound [**2132-8-6**]: FINDINGS: There is normal compressibility, color Doppler and pulse-wave Doppler waveforms of the left common femoral vein, popliteal vein, posterior tibial and peroneal veins. There is non-occlusive thrombus in the superficial femoral vein on the left. Overall, this represents partial resorption of clot seen on the prior exam [**2131-12-30**]. There is normal compressibility, color Doppler and pulse-wave Doppler of the right common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal veins. There is thrombus seen within the duplicated posterior tibial veins. The right peroneal vein was not seen. IMPRESSION: 1. Partially resorbed clot in the left popliteal vein with persistent thrombus in the left superficial femoral vein. 2. New thrombus in the right posterior tibial veins.   Brief Hospital Course: 66 yo male with hx of severe COPD, recent DVT now off coumadin, AAA, and multiple admissions for COPD exacerbations and PNA, p/w COPD exacerbation and found to have multifocal PNA on CT. Patient was admitted with shortness of breath, treated with nebs in the ER, and ultimately required bipap. Patient was transferred to the ICU, where he was weaned off Bipap and eventually tolerating O2 via NC. He was started on Solumedrol and Levaquin/Ceftriaxone. Patient was transferred to the floor on O2 via NC and converted to PO Prednisone. We also stopped the ceftriaxone and continued the levaquin. Patient eventually was tolerating RA and was discharged home with VNA services.  Problem [**Name (NI) **]: 1. COPD Exacerbation: Patient started on ceftriaxone, levaquin, and IV solumedrol on admission and required bipap. He was quickly weaned off bipap and continued on abx and steroids. He rapidly improved clinically and was saturating well on RA upon discharge. He was discharged and instructed to take 50 mg Prednisone daily x 3 days, and taper by 10 every three days thereafter.  2. Multifocal PNA: Patient had leukocytosis on admission and found to have evidence of multifocal PNA on CT. He was started on Levaquin and Ceftriaxone. Blood cultures were negative as was legionella antigen. The leukocytosis quickly resolved over the hospitalization and the ceftriaxone was discharged once patient was transferred to general medicine floor. Patient was discharged after completing a 5 day course of his levaquin.  3. Cavitary Lung Lesion: Seemed to have decreased based on CT done on admission. Patient was intructed to follow up with pulmonologist and PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was read as negative.  4.  DVT: Patient received duplex ultrasound that demonstrated resolving clot in Left superficial femoral. New thrombus found in posteriar tibial. Patient was kept on prophylaxsis heparin dosing.  5. Hyperglycemia: Patient was on insulin sliding scale secondary to steroid use. Patient was also started on basal NPH when he received his dose of steroids. He was instructed to use the NPH at home, starting with 12 units, when he takes his steroid dose every morning. He was instructed to check his glucose via glucometer to make sure sugars were stable. He was instructed to contact PCP with results so that he can taper his daily insulin shot to prevent hypoglycemia.  6. Hyperlipidemia: Stable on atorvastatin.  7. Hypertension: Stable. No medications were required.  8. Osteoporosis: Patient continued on Vitamin D.  Patient remained DNR, but not DNI during this hospitalization. Patient was also advised to stop smoking. He was given scripts for nicotine patches and gum.

106076,"Admission Date:  [**2119-2-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-2-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2079-5-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: cardiac arrest; transferred for cooling protocol  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ICD (defibrillator) placement [**2119-2-17**]   History of Present Illness: This is a 39 yo male who was working on a construction site and was witnessed to fall from a standing position and lose consciousness. He was also reported to have ?seizure activity. Bystanders found him to be unresponsive/pulseless and initiated CPR for 10 minutes. EMS arrived and found him to be in VF arrest which was converted to sinus with 1 shock. He was intubated on the field and transferred to [**Hospital6 **]. On arrival he was unresponsive; and shortly went into PEA arrest and was ?shocked? x 1 with resolution to sinus tach with LBBB. . He was taken to the cath lab which showed 100% RCA and 100% LCx; LAD 20% lesion which appeared ""chronic""; EF 15%. When they tried to cross 1 lesion his HR increased to 180's ?VT; he was shocked with 200J x [**Street Address(2) 70830**] at 120's; he was also hypertensive to the 200's which was treated with ?nitro drip. At [**Hospital6 **] he received 600cc IVF; 325cc IV contrast; 10mg ativan. . Post-cath he was noted again to have seizure-like activity (unsure of character) and was given 10mg ativan and taken to CT scan which was preliminarily read as negative (although on review here may be c/w sub-arachnoid hemorrhage) . On [**Hospital **] transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] he was noted to have decerebrate posturing and L-turning of head.   Past Medical History: HTN heavy alcohol abuse-[**1-20**] vodka every day until 5 days PTA.   Social History: very heave alcohol abuse. In [**Month (only) **] started to drink about [**1-20**] vodka/day until 5 days prior to admission; 2ppd smoker; +MJ, ?cocaine; construction worker  Family History: no early CAD in family  Physical Exam: T 98 HR 107 BP 127/76 RR 30 SaO2 100% Vent settings: AC 12X 600, 100% fiO2, 15 peep Gen: Intubated, sedated HEENT: blood in mouth; poor dentition CV: tachy, no m/r/ ?S3+4?, no murmurs Pulm: CTA B Abd: s/nd/nt; no BS Ext: warm, trace to 1+ DP pulses; no edema neuro: PERRL 3-2.5mm; w/draws all extremities to pain; + corneal reflex; eyes wander (conjugate gaze); unable to assess dolls-head   Pertinent Results: [**2119-2-8**] CT head: IMPRESSION: Slightly limited study due to patient motion. Allowing for this, no evidence of intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage. . The findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 1255**] [**Doctor Last Name **] at 9:40 p.m. on [**2119-2-8**]. The outside hospital CT scan was obtained on hard copy, and will be brought to the file room in the morning. Review of that examination at the time of attending review does show increased density of the tentorium, which presumably relates to the large volume of IV contrast used for what apparently was a cardiac catheterization at that facility, which also resulted in visualization of the vascular tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] on this [**Hospital3 **] CT scan. This tentorial enhancement is no longer seen, likely due to the renal excretion of the contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**]. . [**2119-2-8**] CXR: 1. Successful intubation. 2. Diffuse bilateral hazy ground-glass opacities. This is nonspecific, and may represent diverse etiologies depending on the patient's clinical situation, e.g. aspiration, hemorrhage, or PCP if the patient is immunocompromised. Followup is recommended. . [**2119-2-10**] CXR: Since the prior chest x-ray, the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube have been removed. There has been no significant change since the prior film of six hours previous. The cardiomegaly, effusions, and some edema are still present. . IMPRESSION: Cardiac failure persists. . [**2119-2-10**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Left bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous tracing sinus rhythm is now present.   Brief Hospital Course: #) VF arrest/rhythm: Most likely a primary arrthymic event (based on story of falling, pulseless with CPR for 10min, and Vfib when EMS arrived) and secondary to ischemic scar from old infacts.  Does not appear to be ACS (low level CE, stenosis on cath appeared old).  ECGs during hospitalization showed sinus rhythm/sinus tach with LBBB (no old ECGs for comparison).  He was loaded with amiodarone and maintained on metoprolol for rate control.  He was monitored on telemetry and had no further Vfib events; rhythm strips obtained from EMS and the outside hospital did not capture any v-fib events. He had an ICD implanted on [**2119-2-17**] and tolerated the procedure well.  He will follow up in device clinic on [**2119-3-1**]. . #) CAD/Ischaemia: He was taken for cardiac catheterization and was found to have RCA and LCx occlusion which was thought to be likely chronic. CE's were trended and peaked at low level (likely related to post-code and not consistent with ACS).  He was continued on aspirin, and was titrated up on metoprolol.  A statin was not started right away given his elevated LFTs, but once these normalized, he was started on a reduced-dose statin (20mg atorvastatin) . #) Pump: Cath report showed an EF 15%; Multifactorial; ?acute post code shock, ischemic cardiomyopathy, ?alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Hopefully he will recover some function.  A repeat echo showed an EF of 20-25% with no major valvular abnormalities.  He will need another echo in approximately one month to assess for recovery of his systolic function. . # fevers: He spiked fevers up to 102. He was initially started on levo/metronidazole and vanco before a known source was found to cover for likely aspiration pneumonia and line infections. He was then found to have strep pneumo in his sputum and continued to spike fevers until he was stabilized on an antibiotic regimen of ceftriaxone/azithromycin.  There was also concern that these fevers might be related to alcohol withdrawl and/or drug fever (from phenytoin, which was stopped on [**2-13**]). He completed a five day course of azithromycin and his ceftriaxone will be converted to cefpodoxime to complete a 10-day course. . #) Altered mental status/EtOH withdrawl: This has a multifactorial origin: VF arrest, EtOH, sedation now. Per his sister (whom he lives with) that he drank about [**1-20**] vodka per night for 4 months and then stopped abruptly ~4 days prior to admission.  Neurology was consulted especially given question of seizure activity at the OSH.  An EEG was negative for seizures and an LP showed normal cell count, protein, and glucose with no evidence of infection.  A psychiatry consultation was obtained and they believed that his prolonged delirium may have been benzodiazepine intoxication.  He was maintained on standing Haldol and only short-acting benzo's (lorazepam) were used for his CIWA scale and his mental status gradually improved.  He worked with PT/OT to regain strength, balance, and functioning prior to discharge. . #) Transaminitis: Patient has mildly elevated alt > ast. GGT mildly elevated as well. Most likely secondary to mild shock liver in setting of code. Underlying liver disease from h/o recent heavy EtOH use, high triglycerides (150) could put him at risk for more damage.  His acetaminophen use was limited to 2g/day and he was eventually started on a reduced dose of atorvastatin for his hyperlipidemia. . #) Elevated Cr: Initially had some ARF which was most-likely ATN/hypoperfusion from cardiac arrest. He was hydrated and received mucomyst for cath.  His Cr trended down and recovered. . #) FEN/GI: He was given protonix for GI ppx given alcohol use. He was also ordered for a speech and swallow eval after extubation given his still ""cloudy"" mental status to assess risk for aspiration.  He eventually passed a speech and swallow study, though was recommeded to have close supervision with meals given his distractability.  Heart healthy low sodium diet.

URINE CULTURE (Final [**2135-2-10**]):    <10,000 organisms/ml Pleural Pathology: pending CT chest: FINDINGS: Bulky lymphadenopathy is present in the imaged portion of the lower neck, superior mediastinum, throughout the intrathoracic mediastinum, bilateral hila, and to a lesser extent within the axillary regions. Large right pleural effusion is dependent in location and measures simple fluid density. A small amount of loculated fluid is also present within the major fissure and in the anterolateral portion of the right lower chest. Extensive consolidation is present within the right lower and right middle lobes.  Peribronchiolar abnormalities are present in both upper lobes with a combination of ground glass and consolidation accompanied by bronchial wall thickening and small peribronchial nodules. A dominant peribronchial nodule in the left upper lobe measures 2.2 cm and is surrounded by a halo of ground-glass opacity (26, series 3A). This corresponds to a rapidly growing focal opacity on serial chest x-rays between [**2135-2-8**] and [**2135-2-10**]. Additional peribronchiolar abnormalities are present to a lesser extent within the left lower lobe.  Exam was not tailored to evaluate the subdiaphragmatic region, but note is made of retroperitoneal or intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy as well as incompletely imaged splenomegaly.  Lucent spine lesions within the lower thoracic spine (image 53, series 3A and image 48, series 3A) are probably hemangiomas. Degenerative changes are also noted at multiple levels throughout the spine.  IMPRESSION: 1. Multifocal lung abnormalities most suggestive of a widespread infectious process. Nodular opacity with ground-glass halo in left upper lobe is nonspecific, but this appearance may be associated with angioinvasive Aspergillus infection in the setting of neutropenic fever. 2. Large simple right pleural effusion. 3. Extensive lymphadenopathy, likely related to the provided history of CLL.  Splenomegaly is also in keeping with this diagnosis. 4. Two lucent thoracic vertebral body lesions in the lower thoracic spine which probably reflect hemangiomas. . TTE The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. No clinically significant valvular regurgitation. Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. An area of echodensity measuring 7.4 cm x 4.9 cm (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]) is seen that appears to be contained within a small right pleural effusion. Clinical correlation and consideration of a chest CT for further characterization suggested. . LENI: FINDINGS: Color and [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-scale son[**Name (NI) **] was performed on the bilateral lower extremities. The bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal veins are normal in compressibility, augmentation, and Doppler waveforms. The calf veins are patent and compressible.

Brief Hospital Course: 55 y/o M with hepatitis C andl iver cirrhosis presents to OSH after 1 day of headachae and unsteadiness. Head CT revealed L SDH with midline shift. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further neurosurgical intervention. His platelet count at the OSH was 48, repeat head CT showed no increase in hemorrhage, he was taken emergently to the OR for a L craniotomy for evacuation of L SDH. OR was uncomplicated and patient was transferred to the ICU for monitoring overnight. Post op head CT showed pneumocephalus with good evacuation of blood. On post op examination, he localized bilateral upper extremities and moved BLE spontaneously. On [**4-26**], patient was slightly lethargic, but alert and moving all extremities to commands. He was transferred to step down unit. He remained stable overnight but he also remained hyponatremic. A repeat sodium was 135 after being started on salt tabs.  A repeat urinalysis was also checked to evaluate the UTI that was treated in the emergency room which was essentially negative.  On the evening of [**2128-4-27**], patient bacame hypotensive and required aggressive crystalloid resuscitation.   He responded reasonably but continued to have hypotension in the AM [**4-28**].  He required several boluses of IVFs.  NGT was placed in routine fashion and a CXR confirmed placement in the bowel. Cardiac enzymes and ECG was obtained to rule out cardiac etiology for persistent hypotension.  In addition, medicine was consulted for further recommendations and assistance in management of hypotension.  CK was elevated at 1028.  ECG showed low voltage and thus TTE was recommended by medicine as well as urine studies to rule out rhabdomyolysis.  Required ventilation support for hypoxia.

Of note, she was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 11069**] treated with vancomycin and fluconazole for MSSA and C. parapsilosis osteomyelitis of the fingers and hand, as well as a suspected coagulase-negative staph line infection. Her hospital course was notable for moderate hypertension to 130-150's systolic and she was discharged on lisinopril. . She reports feeling in her usual state of health following discharge. The day prior to presentation she developed some subjective chills and low grade temp to 99F. Overnight, she felt like she ""bit her lip."" When she woke up the morning of presentation, her husband noticed that her lip was swollen. Repeat temperature was 101F leading her to present for further evaluation in the ER. . In the ED, initial vs were T102.3 P 120 BP 146/100 100% on RA. Found to have swelling of upper lip, reported tongue tingling. Also had tenderness over her port.

Vitals T 99 102 137/95 20 100% on RA. Has PIV x1 and port.  . On evaluation in the ICU, she has no major complaints. Denies dyspnea, dysphagia or odynophagia, rash, tearing. She denies ever having similar swelling before. Last dose of lisinopril was the evening prior to presentation. Only other new medication was MS contin, which she also started the day prior to presentation. She notes mild tenderness around her port over the last week, without any erythema or discharge. Apparently her VNA had trouble drawing back from the port last week, but this problem did not persist. She feels that her fingers are healing well - pain is at baseline, no drainage or swelling. . On review of systems she reports mild headache the evening prior to admission and some neck and back discomfort today which is now resolved after steroids. She has occasional sensation of ear ""popping"" but denies sinus or throat discomfort. Has a chronic ""smokers cough"" productive of small amounts of phlegm. She denies nausea or vomiting, but has had mild abdominal discomfort that she notices only when pressing on her abdomen. She has been constipated with last bowel movement the day prior to presentation, no diarrhea. Also denies any dysuria or urinary frequency. Her joint pains are at baseline.

There was never any evidence of respiratory compromise, hypotension or other signs concerning for anaphylaxis. Allergy serologies (tryptase, C1 inhibitor and C2) are pending at time of discharge. Steroids were transitioned to  oral. On discharge patient was scheduled to complete steroid taper over 3 days (20mg x1d, 10mg x1d, 7.5mg ongoing as home dose). She received pepcid and benadryl x48h and then fexofenadine x48h. The presenting lip swelling, tingling resolved within 24h and remained absent during her admission. She is scheduled for follow-up with Allergy within 1 week of discharge. She was instructed to avoid ACEI in the future. The potential use of [**Last Name (un) **] in this setting remains controversial and formal recommendations regarding future use of [**Last Name (un) **] was deferred to the Allergy service. . #Fever: Initial fever and bandemia were concerning for infection. Patient remained afebrile after initial T103F on admission. Of note, there was consideration for prednisone related fever suppression and the patient was advised to continue to monitor for fever during prednisone taper following discharge. . Per discussion with Allergy, ACE related angioedema was likely not an etiology in fever. Most likely sources were felt to be (1) persistent osteomyelitis of the R digits versus (2) CVC endovascular infection. After coordinated discussion with the patient's in-patient and out-patient attendings (ID, Rheumatology, Surgery, Medicine) the decision was made to remove the port. Rationale included (a) prior positive CVC culture with CoNS in the setting of CoNS growing from R hand OR cultures, (b) persistent port site tenderness, (c) limited anticipated use of Port for next several months [immunosuppressive regimen is being deferred until completion of Fluconazole course which is anticipated to end in [**2145-11-30**]], (d) potential future risk for fungal colonization given known Candidal osteomyelitis. There was low concern for other mechanisms of infection including resistant organisms ([**Female First Name (un) 564**] noted as Fluc sensitive, MSSA, CoNS both Vancomycin sensitive), non gram positive organisms (Bld Cx remained negative during this admission; Bld/Port Cx x2), metastatic infection (recent TTE negative for vegetation, no focal si/sx suggestive of other metastatic sites including spleen/abdomen and spine). . She will be scheduled for Port removal with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (PA is [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 8817**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) who will assist in coordination of PICC placement. She was evaluated by the IV team prior to discharge who felt out-patient PICC placement with consideration for IR guidance was an appropriate plan. Of note, the removed Port-A-Cath tip should be sent for culture (bacterial, fungal, AFB). . #HTN: Patient's blood pressures remained 130-150s/80s-110s. Metoprolol was increased from 25mg [**Hospital1 **] to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] with improvement in blood pressures. Additional regimen changes were deferred to the outpatient setting following steroid taper, given potential steroid related contribution to noted hypertension. Patient experienced Metoprolol related GI upset/dysphagia which resolved with administration w/ food. Patient additionally expressed concern re: potential side effects re: Raynaud's and beta blockade. Of note, prior literature supports safety of use of metoprolol specifically in the setting of Raynaud's. . # Mixed connective tissue disease: Her home immunosuppressants were continued and she is to follow-up with rheumatology as outpatient. She was instructed to hold Mobic (an NSAID) pending surgical Port-A-Cath removal. . #Post-operative Pain: Patients pain regimen was continued. MS Contin was increased from 15mg [**Hospital1 **] to 20mg [**Hospital1 **]. . # Anemia: Hematocrit was stably 30-32 during admission.

It was felt that the lip swelling was most likely an allergic reaction to Lisinopril (and to the broader classes of medications known as ACE Inhibitors). You should avoid taking ACE Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers in the future. . Your fever was felt to be most likely related to either osteomyelitis but we could not rule out the possibility of a Port-A-Cath infection. The plan after discussing with several providers involved in your care will be for Port-A-Cath removal next week, interval Linezolid x48h, followed by PICC (IV) placement for the completion of Vancomycin for your known osteomyelitis. . Your blood pressures were elevated during your hospitalization. The dose of Metoprolol was increased from 25mg twice a day to 50mg twice a day. You will need to follow-up with your primary care physician for potential further management of your blood pressure. You may also benefit from purchasing a home blood pressure machine to measure your BPs intermittently. . Please do not take your Mobic for 7 days prior to anticipated Port removal. . If you experience new fever (particularly in the setting of prednisone taper), worsening headache, chest pain, chest pressure, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, diarrhea, back pain, visual changes (decreased acuity, blurriness), or any symptom that concerns you please contact your primary care physician or return to the hospital.

His symptoms, including had leg swelling, mental status, and abdominal pain/nausea have worsened over months to two years.  The urine sediment anaylsis had very large waxy brown muddy casts, consistent with a chronic renal failure picture in addition to possible ATN that could have been induced in the setting of NSAID use. Despite nephrotic range proteinuria, the patient does not have clinically overt nephrotic stigma of diffuse edema. . Definitive diagnosis is to be made upon results of kindey biopsy that was done the day prior to discharge. Prilimiary differential is most likely for focal segmental glomulonephritis given age, ethinithy, and severity of disease. However, all hepatic and HIV serologies were negative. Second most likely given the severity of the hypertension is hypertensive glomulerosclerosis. ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], HIV, hepatitis serologies negative. Normal c3 c4 complement levels and normal SPEP. Urine tox screen was negative. . Patient was receiving daily [**Doctor First Name 2286**] through a tunnelled HD line at the time of discharge and was clinically stable. Patient did not have any symptoms consistent with uremia - no more vague abdominal symptoms, pericarditis, or altered mental status. Patient was seen by nutrition regarding having a renal diet. At the time of discharge, patient was making urine, around 100-200 cc/hr. Patient is to have [**Doctor First Name 2286**] here and to be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] until outpatient [**Last Name (STitle) 2286**] is arranged. Hep B vaccine was administered. . PPD placed LEFT volar forearm on [**909-4-21**], will be read in [**Month Year 2286**] on [**4-23**]. . # HTN - The chronological relationship to renal failure unknown, but clearly made worse by declining renal function.  At the time of discharge, the patient was normotensive with pressures of 121/65 on labetalol and amlodipine. Upon presentation to OSH pressures were 230/130 suggesting a chronic hypertensive picture. Patient says that he had seen a physician as an outpatient within the past year, and was found to be hypertensive and was started on presumably HCTZ, which the patient was non-compliant. Once the results of the renal biopsy are obtained, will consider starting ACEI. . # Hypertriglyergiemia - Could be elevated in the setting of nephrotic disease. LDL was 130 and trigs 288. Patient was started on simvastatin 10mg PO daily. . # Secondary Hyperparathyoidism in the setting of renal failure - PTH elevated 561 suggesting a chronic renal failure picture. The corrected calicium was 7 and the phos 5.8, suggesting that the patient was severely nutritionally deficient. Patient was started on Phos-Lo calcium acetate with meals. . #Abdominal pain - although CTA showed jejunal changes, benign abdominal exam. The [**Doctor First Name 9189**] mesentery appears to be non-specific edema in the setting of small ascities in a malnurished, hypoalbuminemic, uremic patient. Uremia leads to inflammation and can worsen the edema. The symptoms have resolved with the initiation of [**Doctor First Name 2286**] and the patient at the time of discharge did not have any nausea or vomitting. Phorphria was negative. . #Anemia - labs consistent with anemia of chronic disease, most likely secondary to chronic renal failure. EPO being administered with [**Doctor First Name 2286**] and patient being started on folate. Normal ferritin levels. Red cell morphology normal, normal bili. No evidence of hemolysis but elevated LDH. . # Elevated CK - appears idiopathic, and is in the 300-600 range and not correlated clinically to a rhabdomylsis picture. .

Traditional angiography pending.  Cardiac Echo [**6-4**]: Conclusions Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20--25%). There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of mid-to-apical myocardioum. Basal and Apex areas are spared. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF 20-25 %) with regionality; akinesis of mid-to-apical walls with sparing of the apex. Right ventricular systolic function and size is normal. Moderate to severe (3+) tricuspid regurgitation.   CT C-spine [**6-4**]: IMPRESSIONS: 1. No acute traumatic injury seen in the cervical spine. 2. Blood in the basal cisterns tracking inferiorly and anteriorly along the brainstem and upper spinal cord. Thecal sac contents are not adequately assessed on the present study. MR can be considered if there is concern based on neurological examination. 3. Airspace consolidation in the posterior lung apices with smooth septal thickening. Findings along with chest radiograph likely represents some pulmonary edema, although aspiration cannot be excluded.  CT Head [**6-5**]: FINDINGS: The diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage appears stable in extent. Overall, ventricular size has further decreased, compared to the prior study. The ventriculostomy catheter terminating in the region of the third ventricle remains present. There has been further interval progression of bilateral regions of hypoattenuation involving the medial inferior frontal lobes. There is no associated parenchymal hemorrhage. There is no shift of normally midline structures. The streak artifact produced by left distal internal carotid artery coils obscures evaluation in area. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved. Trace intraventricular hemorrhage layering posteriorly in the occipital horns as well as small amount in the third ventricle are stable. The mastoid air cells and imaged paranasal sinuses remain well aerated. IMPRESSION: 1. Slight decrease in ventricular size, compared to the prior study. 2. Further evolution of bifrontal hypoattenuation, which may represent infarcts rather than non-hemorrhagic contusion, given the progression. No parenchymal hemorrhage. MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] head can be considered, if necessary to assess extent and vessels as recommended earlier. 3. Stable extent of diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage.  CXR [**2165-6-5**] Final Report INDICATION: 52-year-old female with subarachnoid hemorrhage, dilated cardiomyopathy. Evaluate for pulmonary edema.  Single AP chest radiographs compared to 13 hours prior shows no change. ET tube tip is 2.3 cm above the carina. Left internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC. The NG tube tip is in the stomach, the sidehole slightly below the gastroesophageal junction. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Again seen are bilateral perihilar opacities consistent with pulmonary edema, not significantly changed from prior exam. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  IMPRESSION: Compared to prior exam from [**2165-6-5**], there is no change in the extent of pulmonary edema.    Cardiac Echo : [**2165-6-11**] Conclusions No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage. Right atrial appendage ejection velocity is good (>20 cm/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %). with mild global free wall hypokinesis. with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. There is no mass/thrombus in the right ventricle. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.  Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-6-4**], left ventricular systolic function has improved. Akinesis of mid-to-apical walls with sparing of the apex has resolved.  Final Report PORTABLE CHEST [**2165-6-19**]:  COMPARISON: Study of earlier the same date.  INDICATION: Feeding tube assessment.  FINDINGS: Feeding tube tip is directed cephalad in region of gastroduodenal junction. Appearance of the chest is similar to the recent radiograph of about 2 hours earlier except for minimal improved aeration in the left retrocardiac region.  [**2165-6-25**] 12:25 PM CT HEAD CT: Axial imaging was performed through the brain without IV contrast administration.  COMPARISON: CT head [**2165-6-23**].  FINDINGS: There is a tract of hypodensity extending along the course of the prior right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter (2:13). There is no hyperdensity along this tract to suggest the presence of hemorrhage. The ventricles are unchanged in size and configuration. There is streak artifact from a left ICA aneurysm coil. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation remains well preserved. There is no evidence of prior subarachnoid hemorrhage. There is no shift of normally midline structures. There is hypodensity in the territory of the left MCA related to prior infarct (2:15), which appear stable without evidence for hemorrhagic transformation. There is a right frontal burr hole otherwise osseous structures are intact. The paranasal sinuses, ethmoid, and mastoid air cells are clear.  IMPRESSION: 1. Post-right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter removal without evidence for hemorrhage. Stable ventricular size.  2. Unchanged appearance to region of infarction in the left MCA distribution without hemorrhagic transformation.   SAT [**2165-6-22**] 12:08 PM Final Report INDICATION: 52-year-old female with transaminitis and fevers. Evaluate right upper quadrant.  COMPARISON: CT chest dated [**2165-6-7**].  FINDINGS: The liver is normal in contour and echotexture. There is a single 1.2-cm cyst identified in the periphery of the right dome. There are no other focal liver lesions identified. There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The common bile duct measures 5 mm. The gallbladder is unremarkable, with no wall thickening, no pericholecystic fluid. There are no stones or sludge identified within the gallbladder. There is normal antegrade flow identified in the main portal vein. The spleen measures 8.7 cm and is normal in appearance. There is no free fluid in the abdomen. Small right pleural effusion is noted.  IMPRESSION:  1. 1.2-cm cyst in the right lobe of the liver, as appreciated on CT of the chest dated [**2165-6-7**]. Liver is otherwise unremarkable.  2. No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for acute cholecystitis. No cholelithiasis.      Brief Hospital Course: 52F admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after transfer from OSH following a witnessed syncopal episode. Head CT performed showing diffuse SAH. CTA of head also performed with preliminarily identified an aneurysm at the left ICA bifurcation. She was loaded with dilantin, and started on nimodipine, and emergent bedside external ventricular drain was placed. She also had a cardiac echo done for concerns of a catacholamine induced cardiomyopathy(had developed pulmonary edema), which showed significantly depressed cardic function. She was placed on a [**Last Name (un) 18821**] monitor to more closely monitor for this. She had an angiogram done on [**6-4**], when the left distal ICA aneurysm was coiled. She then returned to the ICU postoperatively. On [**6-5**](overnight) she had a ICP elevation to 50 and the drain was promplty dropped to 10cm, and ICP normalized. Emergent head CT was done which showed likely evolving brifrontal hypoattenuations/possible stroke. She again returned to angio on [**6-6**] to further evaluate vascualar patency given this new CT finding.The patient was febrile with a Tmax 101.6 and was pan cultured,the urine and cerebral spinal fluid cultures were both neagtive. On [**6-6**] The Dobutamine intravenous drip was off, vasopressors Levophed and neo cont.  The Nimodipine cut in [**12-21**] to maintain goal blood pressures. The patient was brought to angio, there was no significant spasm and given 5mg verapamil-aneurysm stable.  Blood cultures were found to be negative.  The sputum culture was positive for rare yeast.On [**6-7**]: The patient had an acute PaO2 decrease to 50%.  There was a concern for Pulmonary embolusE.  The CTA of the Chest was not consistent with Pulmonary embolus. The CT Head was unchanged. The patient was moniotored for possible Central Diabetes Insipidus. The urine and sputum cultures were both negative. On [**6-8**],  The patient was pan-cultured for a fever to 102. A head CT ordered for elevated ICP to 44, Mannitol was initiated for increased ICPs. A CTA was performed which was consistent with a slight decrease in intercranial vasospasm. On [**6-9**], The patient required 3 doses of mannitol for sustained ICP levels of 23. There were no changes in the patients mental status with these ICP increases.On exam the patient was intermitently following commands in the right upper extremity, the left upper extremity moved to command, the left lower extremity and Right upper extremity withdrew to pain,the patients eyes were open and tracked with her eyes. On [**6-10**], The patient was back on a dobutamine gtt continuously to maintain a goal blood pressure, The patient had a TEE which was consistent with Ejection F of 20%. The LENIS were negative for deep vein thrombosis, The CSF and sputum cultures were negative. On [**6-11**], The patient underwent an angio which was consistent with mild to mod vasospasm.

UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT  [**2110-12-14**] No right lower extremity DVT  Brief Hospital Course: 81 year old woman with h/o htn and rheumatoid arthritis (on chronic steroids) admitted with urosepsis and found to have stress-induced cardiomyopathy (s/p cath [**12-8**]). Found to have thrombocytopenia consistent with HIT and may have suffered a TIA with negative head CT and MRI/MRA. Was placed on argatroban gtt and aggrenox and bridged to coumadin while HIT Ab test was pending. . ## Thrombocytopenia: Patient's platelet count was 122K on admission and dropped three days later to 62K. Differential diagnosis included sepsis, possible HIT I or II. SQ heparin and all flushes stopped. Concurrently, patient developed facial droop, ptosis, tongue deviation and right LE swelling concerning for arterial and venous thrombi. US of right LE negative for DVT. While HIT Ab was pending, patient was started on argatroban gtt. Hematology/oncology was consulted and recommended bridging patient to warfarin. First HIT Ab [**Doctor First Name **] test returned as negative. Argatroban ggt was discontinued after the INR was >3 after a 3 hour trial off argatroban. Second HIT Ab [**Doctor First Name **] was negative suggesting no HIT Ab. Also, per heme/onc time course of thrombocytopenia was shorter than expected for development of HIT Ab (usually 5-6 days) however in the setting of a possible TIA, patient will continue warfarin with goal INR betw [**2-20**] until follow-up at hematology/oncology clinic. . ## Neuro: Had new facial droop and tongue deviation on [**12-11**] thought be a TIA likely secondary to HIT Ab. Head CT was negative for bleed. Head MRI/MRA was negative for acute ischemia. Carotid doppler showed no significant stenosis. HBAIC 6.0 and lipid panel within normal limits. Stroke team was consulted and recommended starting ASA. Patient was switched from salsalate to ASA without adverse drug rxn (hx of asa allergy), and then switched to aggrenox. Patient placed on baby ASA while on coumadin. Unclear whether facial signs were TIA or twitching so EEG was performed which was negative for epileptiform activity. Per stroke, continue ASA until outpatient follow-up. Recommended increasing ASA dose to 325mg once off warfarin. . ## Cardiac: likely stress-induced cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo) versus secondary to sepsis. # Ischemia: patient had PTCA [**12-8**] revealing an LAD 60% occlus, patent Lcx & RCA. Repeat echo [**12-9**] EF 25-30% severe LV hypokinesis and LV sys fcn depression, RV sys fcn depression, no endocarditis. TropI peaked at 25.3 at outside hospital, tropT 1.80 on admission. Patient started on toprol XL 25mg QD, lisinopril 5mg PO QD and baby ASA. Nifedipine was held. # Pump: Patient with low EF in setting of sepsis. Initially hypotensive on levophed and aggressively fluid resuscitated. Patient was on also hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone for 1 week course and then resumed on her outpatient dose of prednisone 1mg PO BID. Patient was gradually weaned off pressors.

Brief Hospital Course: # Coronary Artery Disease: The patient was transfered for cardiac catheterization. Although the patient was found to have 90% PDA lesion, her symptoms and stress test were unclear. It was thought that the patient could benefit from medication managment of CAD with ASA, increased statin and addition of betablocker.  Therefore, she did not undergo repeat cardiac catheterization. Plavix was stopped. If she does develop more chest pain in the future, she could have further optimization of anti-anginal medications and then undergo repeat stress testing.  . # Agitation/Altered Mental Status: Patient became agitated in the pre cath area and was given multiple doses of haldol. This agitation was attributed to delirium [**3-11**] UTI. She was transferred from the CCU to the medicine service on [**2194-7-5**]. She did well with the resolution of her UTI. . She was started on nighttime Zyprexa which we should be stopped in two weeks. . #HCT Drop: Thought to be [**3-11**] Groin oozing into her leg.  Bedside doppler was negative for pseudoanneurysm and there were no bruits on exam.  Her HCT stabilized.  This was complicated by iron deficiency anemia, for which she was started on iron with vitamin C. . # Urinary Tract Infection:  At the outside hospital prior to transfer, she was noted to have a Proteus UTI, and was started on levofloxacin on [**2194-6-30**], switched to ceftriaxone on [**7-1**], then to ciprofloxacin on [**7-3**], based on culture data.  While here she was treated with ciprofloxacin, initially IV due to agitation, and later with PO.

There are low lung volumes. Heart and mediastinum are within normal limits. There is a new patchy focus of consolidation in the right perihilar region.  [**2169-7-29**] CXR: PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes. There is plate-like atelectasis at the left lung base. There is minimal atelectasis at the right lung base as well. Heart and mediastinum are within normal limits.   Brief Hospital Course: When the pt arrived on the floor she was placed on standing nebs and prednisone. During the night, pt felt more SOB and tachypneic. MICU team called for evaluation and the pt was found to have accessory muscle use while sitting up in bed, tachypnea to upper 20s, O2 sat 99% RA.  Pt placed on continuous albuterol neb but subjectively felt her breathing was worse. ABG at that time was 7.4/39/123/25.  Pt was transferred to the MICU for further care. . In the MICU she was started on IV solumedrol, continuous nebulized albuterol and heliox for her asthma exacerbation.  Pt was also placed on levaquin for possible pneumonia.  Pt's respiratory status improved with increased air entry and was transitioned to albuterol q1h.  Intubation was not required. Serial ABGs with pH 7.40-7.46.  Pt experienced sinus tachycardia in the 120s, BP adequate 100-130/50-80.  Thought to be [**3-4**] continuous albuterol -> pt switched to xoponex q1h and ipratroprium q4h.  Pt was able to speak in full sentences and did not show any signs of accessory muscle use.  PEFR was 250 (baseline 450).  Pt was transferred back to the floor. . # Asthma exacerbation: No clear exacebating factors on history beyond increased stress at work. CXR did not show obvious PNA but there was an increased R perihilar density.  Pt was transitioned from IV solumedrol 125mg q8h in the MICU to PO prednisone 50mg on the floor.  Pt was also continued on ipratroprium q4h with xoponex nebs q1h prn.  The pt's advair was held [**3-4**] systemic steroid use.  Pt did well with this therapy for about a day and then became acutely short of breath with RR in the high 20's, O2 sat 91% on RA, PEFR 125 and sinus tachycardia to the 150s.  Pt responded well to 4L O2 by NC, IV solumedrol 125mg x1, Combivent and IV Ativan 2mg (it was felt that there was a large component of anxiety contributing to the pt's respiratory distress).  Pt did well with this episode and did not require further IV steroids.  Pt continued to do well on ipratroprium q4h and xoponex nebs q1h prn (pt received roughly q4h). Outpatient loratidine and flonase were continued to control her allergies, which could contribute to her exacerbation.  Pt was able to ambulate with RA O2 sats from 91-93% on [**8-2**].  On the day of discharge pt felt much better, was ambulating without supplemental O2.  O2 sat on RA was 98%.  PEFR increased to 250.  Minimal upper-airway wheezing.  Pt will be discharged with a steroid taper, 50mg qdaily x 5days, 40mg qdaily x 5days, 30mg qdaily x 5days, 20mg qdaily x 5days and 10mg qdaily until she sees her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will be sent home with Atrovent nebs q6h prn. . # Pneumonia: CXR was suggestive of pneumonia and pt was treated with Levaquin 750 mg IV for 5 days.  Pt had ? history of MRSA pneumonia although there were no records of this.  WBC trended down after treatment with ABX.  Sputum cultures showed 3+ gram+ cocci in pairs/cluster and 2+ gram+ rods.  This expectorated sample was adequate (<10 sq epis), however it was collected after multiple doses of Levaquin.  Clinically pt improved, using incentive spirometry and ambulating as tolerated with RA O2 sats from 91-93% on [**8-2**].  RA O2 sats 98% on the day of discharge. Final sputum culture revealed growth of oropharyngeal flora. . # Tachycardia: Pt had sinus tachycardia in the MICU to the 120s and on the floor peaked to the 150s.  There were multiple causes of her tachycardia - hypoxemia, continuous albuterol nebs in the MICU, anxiety, pain and possible infection.  Pt was not anemic or febrile (on steroids) and clinically she did not appear hypovolemic.  No EKG changes were noted.  Pt was monitored on telemetry.  Pt's tachycardia improved after d/c of albuterol and as her exacerbation was treated with steroids and nebulizers. . # Bipolar Disease: Pt not currently manic or depressed.  Pt was continued on her outpatient fluoxetine, trazodone, thorazine, and carbamazepine. . # Bulimia: Pt had poor PO intake [**3-4**] pain and SOB according to the pt.  She was continued on her outpatient naltrexone. . # Thrush: Treated with nystatin. . # Hypothyroidism: On [**5-9**] TSH was 3.9. Outpatient levothyroxine was continued. . # B12 Deficiency: Pt receives vit B12 monthly inj. . # FEN/GI: Pt was started on Vitamin D and Calcium given her recurrent use of systemic steroids. Pt should continue vitamin D and calcium as an outpatient, if she needs a prescription she can follow with her PCP.

We noted no gas or stool in his ostomy bag. we attempted to manage him conservatively, but a repeat CT on [**2172-1-26**] showed no improvement in his distal ileal small-bowel obstruction with discrete transition point identified in the right lateral mid abdomen. He went to the OR on [**2172-1-27**] for: 1. Exploratory laparotomy. 2. Extended adhesiolysis. 3. Small-bowel resection with primary anastomosis.  He was NPO, with IVF and a NGT. The NGT was removed on POD 4. We slowly advanced his diet as he had return of bowel function. He was on TPN while we awaited return of bowel function. He was tolerating fulls on POD 7 and regular diet POD 8 and the TPN was weaned off. His incision was C/D/I with a small amount of redness along the distal part of the incision. The staples were left in place and should be removed on Monday/Tuesday next week with steri strips applied.  CHF: He has chronic diastolic documented heart failure. We monitored his cardiac function and he received his home meds when appropriate along with diuretics as described below.  Resp: He remained intubated post-operatively and was transferred to the ICU. He was extubated on POD 2 and did well. He was on a 50% face tent in the ICU. Good pulmonary toilet was encouraged, including ambulation and IS. We assess his respiratory status and he received diuresis when appropriate. He continued on O2 by nasal cannula once out on the floor.  GU: He was receiving fluid resuscitation and albumin initially for hypovolemia. and then diuresis when appropriate. His BUN/Cr remained slightly elevated and stable. He was having urinary incontinence.  Hypernatremia: He is on chronic Torsemide treatment for his CHF. His sodium was elevated since admission. His fluids were changed to D5W. Hypernatremia likely due to diuretics and NGT suction. His torsemide was held, as he did not appear fluid overloaded and he was gently hydrated with D5W. His sodium slowly recovered and was stable.  Endo: He was followed by [**Last Name (un) **] for blood glucose control. He was taking Lantus and a Humalog sliding scale. A cortisol stimulation test was negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 98.7 degrees Fahrenheit, her blood pressure was 136/70, her pulse was 90, her respiratory rate was 16, and she was saturating 98% on room air.  In general, the patient is an elderly female in no apparent distress.  She appeared pale and fatigued.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination the oropharynx was clear.  The mucous membranes were dry. Nasogastric tube with blood.  The neck was supple.  The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart was regular in rate and rhythm plus a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There were good bowel sounds. Maroon-tinged stool.  Guaiac-positive.  No melena. Extremities revealed needed.  Multiple bruise-like lesions with central hardness on arms and legs.  No evidence of rashes.  Neurologically, cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  She followed commands.  PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count was 5.8 (with a differential of 76% neutrophils, 21% lymphocytes, 2% monocytes, and 1% eosinophils), her hematocrit was 27.4 (down from 30 on admission to the Emergency Department), and her platelets were 127.  Her INR was 1.1, her partial thromboplastin time was 24.9. Chemistry-7 revealed her sodium was 137, potassium was 6 (repeat 4.9), chloride was 108, bicarbonate was 20, blood urea nitrogen was 51, creatinine was 1.2, and her blood glucose was 115.  Urinalysis was straw colored, specific gravity of 0.018, trace leukocyte esterase, pH of 5.  PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm at 79 beats per minute, and primary atrioventricular block.  Q wave in II, III, and F.  Normal axis.  Peaked T waves in precordium.  ASSESSMENT:  The patient is an 88-year-old female with a gastrointestinal bleed after taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for the last two weeks for left leg pain.  BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  1.  GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED ISSUES:  The patient had an initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**4-11**] which showed a big clot adherent to a large-sized hiatal hernia.  The clot was too large to safely irrigate off.  Underneath the clot could have been an ulcer erosion or [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear.  In the stomach, there was diffuse atrophy of the mucosa with no bleeding noted; compatible with chronic atrophic gastritis. There was no bleeding in the duodenum.  The patient was kept on strict nothing by mouth and intravenous fluids, and her hematocrit levels were followed to keep her hematocrit above 30.  Her hematocrit dropped initially from 30.3 to 27.4 and then to 22.6.  She was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells, and her hematocrit has been stable since, ranging from 30 to 32, with no further episodes of bleeding since [**4-12**].  She has remained on a proton pump inhibitor (Protonix) twice per day.  A repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed on [**4-14**] showed still adherent clot about 8 cm in length and 2 cm in width, adherent to a 2-cm length mucosa within the large hiatal hernia.  There were no signs of active bleeding. Electrocautery was applied to the base of the clot in an attempt to dislodge it from the esophageal mucosa and for hemostasis; however, despite the clot still remained adherent to the esophageal mucosa.  It appeared that there may be an ulceration and mucous in the area of the esophagus to which the clot was adherent.  Otherwise, the stomach and the duodenum were normal on the repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  The patient was kept nothing by mouth for the remaining portion of [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**4-14**], and was continued on intravenous fluids.  Since her hematocrit remained stable on the following day ([**4-15**]), she was started on clear liquids in the morning, and diet may be advanced to soft solids until her repeat upper endoscopy next week which has already been scheduled.  Since her hematocrit has been stable for the last several days, the patient is safe to be discharged to home or to rehabilitation.  An upper endoscopy followup has been scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21140**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2161**] at the Endoscopy Unit on the [**Location (un) 448**] of [**Hospital Ward Name 1950**] One [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] Building on [**2104-5-8**] at 9:30 a.m.  The patient should not have anything to eat after midnight on [**2104-5-7**] and should not eat breakfast on the morning of [**2104-5-8**] (on the morning of the esophagogastroduodenoscopy).  Her aspirin and Plavix should be held considering her gastrointestinal bleed, and restarting of these two medications will be made after her repeat endoscopy on [**5-8**].  The patient should remain on Protonix 40 mg by mouth twice per day until her repeat endoscopy, and she should avoid nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs until her procedure.  The patient will also probably benefit from a colonoscopy as an outpatient.  Helicobacter pylori antibody was still pending.  2.  THROMBOCYTOPENIA ISSUES:  Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibody was positive, so the patient should not receive any heparin.  The patient has a history of a mild pancytopenia in the past, and this issue was discussed between the patient and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] of Hematology/Oncology, and it was decided that no bone marrow biopsy would be performed.  The patient should follow up as an outpatient with her primary care physician to insure that she has a rise in her platelets.  3.  HYPERKALEMIA ISSUES:  The patient had an initial potassium value of 6 with peaked T waves on electrocardiogram.  This was thought to likely be due to dehydration, and the blood sample was also moderately hemolyzed.  Otherwise, her potassium has remained stable.  4.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient does have an element of diastolic dysfunction, and so her fluid status was carefully monitored a she was getting significant amounts of fluids and packed red blood cells.  She has maintained stable oxygenation, and good oxygen saturations, as well as good urine output.  5.  COAGULOPATHY ISSUES:  The patient developed an INR of 1.4; likely secondary to being nothing by mouth for many days and deficiency in vitamin K.  She has been given by mouth vitamin K and should continue this for two more days.  Her INR will likely decrease when she receives adequate nutrition.  6.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  As mentioned above, aspirin and Plavix were being held secondary to a large gastrointestinal bleed.  The patient should continue to hold these two medications until her repeat endoscopy on [**5-8**]; at which time the decision as to whether to restart these medications can be made.  The patient has been restarted on her beta blocker.  She will continue with her statin, Imdur beta blocker, and ACE inhibitor.  7.  CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ISSUES:  The patient's creatinine is at baseline.  Her blood urea nitrogen was likely increased secondary to bleeding and has now returned to [**Location 213**].  8.  LEFT LEG PAIN ISSUES:  The patient had a previous zoster infection that was treated with Valtrex.  On admission, she had no evidence of a zoster infection with no rashes apparent.  The patient has multiple musculoskeletal complaints that have been chronic.  She was continued on her Neurontin for neuropathic pain.  The patient was also given Tylenol for pain control.   She does not have an active zoster infection.  9.  PSYCHIATRIC ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her BuSpar.  She has multiple somatic complaints; likely anxiety related.  10.  ACIDOSIS/FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient's acidosis was improving as her diarrhea improved. It will likely continue to improve as she maintains a normal diet and her diarrhea continues to decrease.   She was started on a clear diet on [**4-15**] following her esophagogastroduodenoscopy since her hematocrit has been stable.  11.  PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on pneumatic boots and a proton pump inhibitor.  The patient should not receive any heparin secondary to positive heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibody.  12.  ACCESS ISSUES:  The patient has difficult access issues and two peripheral intravenous lines through most of her stay.  13.  CODE STATUS ISSUES:  The patient is a full code.  14.  DISPOSITION ISSUES:  At the time of this dictation, a Physical Therapy consultation has recommended benefit from rehabilitation for maximum safety.  The patient is being screened for rehabilitation at the time of this dictation.  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1.  Gastrointestinal bleed. 2.  Anemia. 3.  Chronic renal insufficiency. 4.  Coronary artery disease. 5.  Anxiety/depression.  DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation.  CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.  MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1.  Protonix 40 mg by mouth twice per day. 2.  Metoprolol 25 mg by mouth twice per day. 3.  Nystatin 5 mg by mouth four times per day as needed (for thrush). 4.  Gabapentin 300 mg by mouth twice per day. 5.  Cepacol one lozenge by mouth as needed. 6.  Oxycodone 2.5 mg to 5 mg by mouth q.4-6h. as needed. 7.  Tylenol 1000 mg by mouth three times per day. 8.  Ferrous sulfate 325 mg by mouth once per day. 9.  BuSpar 5 mg by mouth twice per day. 10.  Mirtazapine 30 mg by mouth at hour of sleep. 11.  Isosorbide mononitrate extended release 45 mg by mouth once per day. 12.  Atorvastatin 20 mg by mouth once per day.  DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP: 1.  The patient was instructed to follow up with her primary care physician in one to two weeks. 2.  The patient has a follow-up esophagogastroduodenoscopy scheduled for [**5-8**] at 9:30 a.m. with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21140**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2161**] at the Endoscopy Unit, [**Location (un) 448**] of [**Hospital Ward Name 1950**] One, [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] Building.  The patient should register in the lobby of the [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] Building at 8:30 a.m. and should not have anything to eat after midnight on [**2104-5-7**].  She should not eat breakfast on the morning of [**2104-5-8**]. 3.  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy reports have been sent with the patient to rehabilitation, and the patient should bring these papers with her to her esophagogastroduodenoscopy appointment.

However, she developed abd pain after the colonoscopy. She went home, noted severe abd pain and presented to [**Hospital3 **] hospital. Presented with mildly increased distension of abdomen - KUB and CT showed no free air, but did show increased air in colon which could have resulted from [**Last Name (un) **]. [**Hospital3 **] spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] who recommended paracentesis, but they did not feel comfortable doing this. Therefore, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] requested she receive a dose of ceftriaxone and be transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. . In the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], the patient had a diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis which drained 2.7L of amber liquid. Peritoneal fluid was negative for SBP with 31 WBC, culture pending. She also received phenergan, morphine, and 1000cc NS. . The patient was admitted to medicine for further evaluation of abdominal pain. Upon arrival to the floor, the patient had 3 episodes of coffee ground emesis (approx 350cc total) with a 6 point drop in Hct. Liver fellow was contact[**Name (NI) **] who recommended IV protonix, octreotide, and transfer to MICU for emergent EGD and monitoring. In the MICU an EGD was performed which showed grade III varices which were banded. Following this procedure and multiple blood transfusion, her Hct has stabilized at 34.  Given persistent complaints of tense abdomen and pain, have made multiple attempts to repeat paracentesis - hindered by dilated loops of bowel.

She received a total of 3 U PRBC during  MICU course. She is now hemodynamically stable and her HCT has remained stable since transfusions. Patient recieved Octreotide for total of 5 days  Patient continued on Protonix 40 mg po BID. Patient given sucralfate. Nadolol was held. . 2) ABDOMINAL PAIN - There was concern for perforation given recent colonoscopy; however, X-ray and Abd CT @ OSH did not show evidence of free air, and repeat upright CXR @ [**Hospital1 18**] shows no free air. Also considered was SBP from bacterial translocation from colonoscopy. Pt received ceftriaxone at OSH, but pt only had 31 WBC by paracentesis. Abdominal pain improved since initial paracentesis in ED; now ascites redeveloped and pain has returned. Ceftriaxone/Rifaximin was given immunosuppression and elevated WBC. She recieved morphine prn for pain. . A second paracentesis was attempted; however only 10 cc of fluid was removed.

He felt this pain may have been his GERD but did not improve with tums.  At [**Company 191**] (his PCP's office), he was noted to be look weak and an EKG was concerning for ? new anterior-lateral changes.  In the ED, initial vs were: 98, 84, 136/88, 18, 96% 2L. On arrival to ER, EKG was NSR without ST changes, and labs were significant for trop of 0.31, platelets of 9, leukocytosis to 35 with 88% ""other"" cell types and hematocrit of 21.  Repeat EKG was still non-ischemic and cardiology felt his troponins were not due to active ischemia.  Given his platelets, there were no plans for intervention.  Heme/onc was consulted to review his smear given concern for acute leukemia.  Patient was given one sublingual nitro and started on morphine for pain control.  He was moving very little air on exam and felt to be having a COPD exacerbation.  He was given solumedrol, ceftriaxone, azithromyin, cefepime and albuterol/ipratropium nebs.  Patient was transferred to the ICU for further management.  At time of transfer, vitals were 98.7, 93, 150/68, 20, 94% 3L NC.  In the ICU, he endorses having had chest pain for the past couple weeks that he felt was heartburn and epigrastric pain. Over this time period, he has also had some generalized weakness and cough productive of blood tinged sputum.  He feels his scattered arm bruises are related to tripping and falling a few days ago.   Past Medical History: # Pneumonia that was slow to resolve, requiring 2-3 months of ABX [**9-21**] # COPD with 2L home O2 # History of asbestos exposure # psoriasis # hyperlipidemia # arthritis # hypertension # depression # venous insufficiency  Social History: He is married and has a daughter who is his HCP.

This limited/ incomplete study may not rule out mosaicism at a level that is standard for such an analysis. Two cells contained an extra copy of chromosome 8 (TRISOMY 8) and a TRANSLOCATION of chromosomes 15 and 17. This translocation is associated with PML-RARA fusion and is a characteristic finding in acute promyelocytic (M3) leukemia. ----------------INTERPHASE FISH ANALYSIS, 100-300 CELLS------------------- nuc ish(PML,RARA)x3(PML con RARAx2)[89/100] FISH evaluation for a PML-RARA rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the LSI PML/RARA Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for PML at 15q22 and RARA at 17q21.1 and is interpreted as ABNORMAL. Rearrangement was observed in 89/100 nuclei, which exceeds the normal range (up to 1% dual rearrangement) for this probe in our laboratory. A PML-RARA rearrangement is found in most acute promyelocytic leukemias (FAB M3). This test was developed and its performance determined by the [**Hospital1 18**] Cytogenetics Laboratory as required by the CLIA '[**25**] regulations. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This test is used for clinical purposes.  FLOW CYTOMETRY: RESULTS: Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to optimize blast yield. Abnormal cells comprise 82% of total gated events. B-cells comprise 6% of lymphoid-gated events, are polyclonal, and do not express aberrant antigens. T-cells comprise 57% of lymphoid-gated events, express mature lineage antigens, and have a normal helper-cytotoxic ratio of 1.04 (usual range in blood 0.7-3.0). Cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cells isolated from this peripheral blood express myeloid associated antigens (CD13, CD33 (bright), CD15 (bright, subset), express CD64, CD71, lack B and T cell associated antigens, are CD10 (cALLAa) negative, and are negative for CD34, HLA-DR, CD14, CD41, CD11C, CD56 and Glycophorin A.  Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by acute myeloid leukemia.  Lack of CD34 and HLA-DR [**Last Name (STitle) **] promyelocytic differentiation.  However, correlation with concurrent cytogenetic findings is recommended for further characterization. . IMAGING: ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2148-9-20**] Conclusions The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, with some regional variation (the anterior septum, anterior free wall, and apex appearing more hypokinetic than the other walls) (LVEF = 30 %). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.  Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-5-26**], contractile function of both ventricles is now significantly reduced.  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST   [**2148-9-23**] 6:31 PM IMPRESSION: Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe, with surrounding vasogenic edema and local mass effect. A hypodense lesion with smaller hemorrhagic component is also seen in the right occipital lobe, with two additional non-hemorrhagic hypodense lesions seen in the left cerebellar hemisphere and the right parieto-occipital cortex. Given the multifocality of these lesions, and history of malignancy, these may represent metastases with associated hemorrhage. An alternate consideration is multiple infarctions, some hemorrhagic, likely embolic. MRI with and without contrast would be helpful for further evaluation.  MRI BRAIN    [**2148-9-24**] 3:27 PM CONCLUSION: Multiple acute areas of infarction, many with hemorrhage. The distribution suggests emboli from a proximal source, most likely cardiac. 5-6 mm anterior communicating artery aneurysm. The location of the hemorrhages does not imply prior bleeding from this aneurysm. Within the limits of an adequate but not optimal MRA examination, no other intracranial vascular abnormalities are detected.  ECHOCARDIOGRAM   [**2148-9-25**] at 1:30:32 PM   Conclusions: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. RV hypokinesis is seen. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is small vegetation (4mm) on the mitral valve attached to the posterior leaflet on the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]. Mild to moderate ([**12-16**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.  IMPRESSION: Small vegetation of the mitral valve. Complex, non-mobile atheroma of the aortic arch. Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.  CT HEAD    [**2148-10-1**] 8:28 PM IMPRESSION: 1. No interval change since [**2148-9-24**], with unchanged appearance of right frontal parenchymal hematoma with associated edema, local mass effect and stable degree of leftward shift of normally-midline structures. 2. Hypodense lesions in the right occipital and parietal occipital cortex appear grossly unchanged but are not further characterized on this motion- degraded study.   LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: [**2148-10-3**] 1:45 PM Findings: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) **] of right subclavian vein was performed and shows normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation. Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) **] of left subclavian, left internal jugular, left axillary, left brachial, left basilic, and left cephalic veins were performed. The left internal jugular vein shows normal flow and augmentation.  There is abnormal flow in the left subclavian vein, left axillary vein, and left basilic vein. Hypoechoic foci consistent with clots are also clearly visualized in the left basilic and left axillary veins. These findings are consistent with an upper extremity thrombus in the left subclavian vein, left axillary vein, and left basilic vein.   Brief Hospital Course: 66 yo man h/o severe emphysema who presented with a new diagnosis of APML and NSTEMI with EF 30%, s/p intubation [**9-20**] with extubation on [**9-27**], found to have large IPH, multiple strokes, and endocarditis.  # APML: Mr. [**Known lastname 104371**] was diagnosed with APML by peripheral smear, flow cytometry, and PCR of the blood. He was treated with ATRA and hydroxyurea initially and when his WBC was <10K, his hydroxyurea was stopped. He also received steroids initially for prophylaxis of ATRA syndrome and this was gradually weaned. He was monitored for tumor lysis and DIC and transfused blood products prn to keep his fibrinogen >100 and INR <1.5. His platelet goal was initially 20K but this was increased to 100K after his intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  # NSTEMI with new heart failure (EF 35%): Mr. [**Known lastname 104371**] initially presented to his PCP's office with chest pain. He had elevated troponins on admission with no ST or T wave changes on EKG, c/w NSTEMI. We trended his troponins which plateaued at 3.50. His first ECHO showed moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, with some regional variation (the anterior septum, anterior free wall, and apex appearing more hypokinetic than the other walls) and LVEF = 30 %. He was monitored on telemetry and had no significant arrhythmias. Given his concurrent IPH (see below), antiplatelet & anticoagulant agents are contraindicated and he was medically managed with nitrates, beta-blockers, low-dose ACE-i and a statin. Repeat ECHO on [**2148-9-25**] showed a persistent small vegetation of the mitral valve, complex, non-mobile atheroma of the aortic arch, and mild regional LV systolic dysfunction (EF 45%).  # Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: On the morning of [**2148-9-23**], it was noted that Mr. [**Known lastname 104371**] was not moving his L arm. CT head showed a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe, with surrounding vasogenic edema and local mass effect. A hypodense lesion with smaller hemorrhagic component was also seen in the right occipital lobe, with two additional non-hemorrhagic hypodense lesions seen in the left cerebellar hemisphere and the right parieto-occipital cortex. MRI/A on [**2148-9-24**] revealed multiple areas of acute infarction, many with hemorrhage, with a distribution that suggests emboli from a proximal source, likely cardiac. Unclear etiology for embolism ?????? blood cultures are negative to date to assess for bacteremia. TEE showed aortic plaque that could be potential embolic source. MRA showed a 5-6mm communicating artery aneurysm as well. Neurosurgery had no plans for intervention. Neurology was consulted & recommended EEG which showed a diffuse encephalopathy pattern and a focal area with epileptogenic potential, but no electrographic seizures. All antiplatelet/anticoagulant agents were held.  DIC labs were stable, with a platelet count goal of >100K. He was able to be extubated on [**2148-9-27**] and PT/OT was consulted for help managing/recovering from his stroke. He continued to suffer from mood lability on the floor and intermittently refused his medications. Neurology continued to follow him. EEG was repeated and did not show any seizure activity, just a diffuse encephalopathy. Haldol 0.5mg IV was used [**Hospital1 **] prn for mood stabilization as he refused.  # Respiratory Distress/Hypoxia: On presentation, he was hypoxic and required oxygen support by nasal cannula (up to 6L). It was felt to be multifactorial, with his underlying emphysema, acute systolic heart failure, pulmonary edema, and pneumonia contributing. Following his IPH, he was intubated for airway protection on [**2148-9-20**] with successful extubation on [**2148-9-27**]. Bronchoscopy on [**2148-9-26**] showed edematous airways with friability but no frank blood. BAL grew yeast (it was initially reported as mold, concerning for Aspergillus, but galactomannan/glucan were normal and it was re-read as yeast). He is s/p 8 day course of cefepime and levofloxacin for his pneumonia. Following extubation, he was maintained on his home COPD medications and was maintaining stable O2 sats on room air.   # Culture-negative endocarditis:  ECHO on [**2148-9-25**] showed a small vegetation on mitral valve.  Unclear if this is infectious versus malignant.  Added vancomycin (d1=[**9-25**]) for MRSA endocarditis coverage and started ceftriaxone (d1=[**9-27**]).  Had abdominal CT [**2148-9-26**] which did not show any infectious source. Per ID, 6 week course of antibiotics recommended.  # LUE edema: LUE>RUE edema, of hand and arm. Patient had PICC placed in left arm [**2148-9-27**] and his edema was concerning for DVT. Given his recent IPH, anticoagulation was not an option. Left upper extremity U/S done on [**2148-9-27**] to r/o DVT was negative. Edema and pain persisted, so a repeat LUE U/S was done on [**2148-10-3**] and showed extensive DVT of the L subclavian, axillary and basilic vein. The PICC line was removed on [**2148-10-3**] and a peripheral IV was placed.  On [**2148-10-4**], the family expressed a desire to transfer his care to [**Hospital1 2025**]. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (NI) 653**] the inpatient hematologic malignancy team who accepted the patient in transfer.

She presented with an INR of 4.3 and was given one dose of vitamin K and a dilantin load. Head CT showed bilateral frontal IPH and SAH. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further neurosurgical workup. Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 **], patient was given 2 units of FFP and profiline in the ED for an INR of 5. She was admitted to the ICU for neurosurgical observation.  Her exam was nonverbal and confused, but full strength. She was cleared by the trauma service of further injuries. On [**9-25**], patient's exam much improved, she is alert to self and full strength. Repeat head CT stable and patient's INR was 1.3. While in the ICU she went in to rapid afib with heart rate in the 140's and she was started on a diltiazem iv drip with plan to wean to PO diltiazem.  On [**9-26**] pt had a repeat CT head that showed no change from her previous scan. Her INR remained below 1.3. She remained in the ICU to continue her diltiazem IV drip for treatment of her atrial fibrilation. Cardiology was consulted for further management and felt it was safe to discontinue her IV and PO diltiazem and remain on her amiodarone PO. Her lopressor was increased per their recommendations to 50mg twice daily. Her heart rate remained stable and had no further episodes of rapid atrial fibrilation.  [**Date range (1) 80149**] Pt transfered to the floor in stable condition. Repeat head ct showed no change in size of contusions and was stable when compared to previous exams. Her blood pressure was noted to be in the 170s, and cardiology recommended adding HCTZ to her current regimen.

At presentation on [**1-31**], there was no clear evidence of infection given that her WBC was normal and she was afebrile. Her nephrostomy pigtail was replaced and antegrade pyelogram indicated functional nephrostomy tube and persistent distal ureteral obstruction. On CXR, the lungs were clear. She was admitted for pain control. However, her UA revealed >100K WBCs and, on [**2-1**], she mounted a fever to 100.7F. She was placed on zosyn and vancomycin was added when she was persistently febrile.  Despite urine WBC count as above, urine cultures revealed only yeast 10-100K.  A pain consult was requested and they recommended dilaudid PCA. She was started on the dilaudid PCA, but had several episodes of hypotension while on increased narcotics for her pain requiring transfer to the ICU for monitoring.  Her PCA was discontinued and her fentanyl patch was restarted.  Psychiatry was consulted for management of depression and affective instability and recommendations regarding her multiple medications including clonazepam, lorazepam, mirtazapine and narcotics.  During her stay, she was showing signs of mild delirium with decreased attention and concentration.  Thus psychiatry recommended continuing her mirtazapine and clonazepam, but suggested limiting prn ativan and narcotics as possible, recognizing the difficulty in this given her chronic pain.  They also suggested using seroquel for anxiety and insomnia.  In the setting of increased pain medication, specifically narcotics, she became hypotensive to 70s systolic.  She was mildly lightheaded at this time.  She was transferred to the ICU where she received IV fluids to which her BP responded with systolics returning to the low 100s mmHg.  Her hypotension was thought more likely [**2-8**] to her pain medication regimen and poor PO rather than hypotension [**2-8**] to sepsis.  During her stay, multiple family meetings including her pastor were had to evaluate code status.  She had previously been in the care of hospice prior to this admission.  During her stay in the setting of hypotension, code status was readdressed and she decided that she no longer wished DNR/DNI, but wanted full code. While in the ICU, this was again readdressed with her family, pastor, and patient, and code status was changed to CMO.  She requested transfer back to her home hospice care.

He required levophed and aggressive fluid hydration to maintain SBP>100 and was started on fludrocotisone for possible adrenal insufficiency. Pt had flat JVP and warm extremities, no evidence of tamponade. He was ruled out for MI by enzymes, and cardiology consult did not not think picture was c/w cardiogenic shock. A cortasyn stim test was performed and he was seen to respond, so we discontinued fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone. Sepsis was considered and he was broadly covered on admission with ambisome, imipenem, voriconazole. He was weaned off vasopressors and IVF on HD3 and SBP's remained in the 90's but he was asymptomatic, making urine, and had normal lactate so no further intervention was made. . #ID: a) Pulmonary nodules: Pt had history of pulmonary nodules thought to be of fungal origin without positive cultures data. He had been on empiric treatment for fungal process with ambisome and vorinazole for 3 months, then voriconazole alone since [**4-1**], but was off this for four days before admission. Chest CT revealed no nodular infection but a RLL infiltrate concerning for CAP and on HD2 was started on levofloxacin. At that same time he was started on Vancomycin since his allergy was questionable and he had a permanent tunneled line. He developed periorbital edema and diffuse skin etyhema, elevated LFT's and eosinophilia thought initially due to vancomycin so this was stopped. Vancomycin was changed to daptomycin which was stopped [**4-21**] given blood cultures remained negative x 48 hours. Infectious workup in looking for source of sepsis included urine, blood and sputum culture, fungal , AFB, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 14616**], mycoplasma, [**Name10 (NameIs) 14616**] urine Ag, galatomannan all of which were negative. Pt's LFT's continued to rise off of the vancomycin so the levofloxacin was changed to azithromycin which he completed a 10 day course of. He was then started on voriconazole as below for risk of recurrence of fungal infection with immunosuppressive treatment for GVHD as below.  Elevated LFT's-Pt continued to have climbing LFT with a cholestatic picture initially thought to be due to drug reaction by both ID and dermatology. Skin biopsy showed complete separation of dermis and epidermis consistent with drug rash. Alkaline phosphatase continued to rise despite rash improving so then arose concern for GVHD as had occured in the past. At this point he was started on cyclosporine dosed to trough >100 and a day later Mycofenolate was added. Liver team was consulted and felt this was most likely GVHD and got a liver biopsy. Biopsy revealed diffuse biliary destruction consistent with GVHD although it was unclear if this was old or new. He was continued on immunosuppressive therapy as above and on [**5-3**] was feeling well so plan was made for further workup and treatment of elevated LFT's as an outpt. . #Chest/Neck pain: T wave changes on EKG were non-diagnostic. It didn't appear to be due to ischemia given he was ruled out for MI with serial enzymes and had no events on telemetry. CTA showed no PE/aortic dissection. Most likely cause of pain is pleuritic chest pain from pneumonia. He was treated with his outpatient dose of oxycontin in hospital which he responded well to. . #Anemia: baseline hct was around 28 thought to be anemia of chronic diseae. Hemolysis labs were negative     Medications on Admission: Acyclovir 400 mg po bid (For Zoster ppx) Voriconazole 200 mg po bid (unable to fill for last three days)  Imipenenem 500mg q 6 hour Aerosolized pentamidine qmonth (For PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] last dose4/19) Diphenhydramine prn Oxycodone SR 60 mg po bid Oxycodone 5-10 mg po q6h breakthrough Lorazepam 2 mg po q4-6h prn   Discharge Medications: 1.

History of Present Illness: 84M with lymphoma s/p CHOP last week, h/o GIB, dilated CMP, who originally presented from home with hematemesis x2, after taking high dose prednisone during chemotherapy as well as Bufrin for arthritis. Patient denied melena, abdominal pain, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, chills or chest pain. Patient has had UGIB in past with NSAID use. Patient came to ED, with VS 96.8, 100, 119/65, 18, 100%RA and A and O times 3. At home, patient is functional in his ADLs, grocery shopping and driving on his own, and taking care of his wife with [**Name (NI) 2481**] disease. Patient is very noncompliant at home.  He was given PPI, received NGT lavage, which did not clear after 1L, and patient was fluid resuscitated prior to transfer to the MICU for emergent endoscopy. In the MICU, patient had endoscopy showing multiple gastric ulcers, which were clipped, injected with epinephrine, and Bicapped. He remained hemodynamically stable. Patient was also found to have an evolving STEMI, with isolated ST elevation in V3, as well as CE with peak troponin of 1.48 on [**2188-2-6**]. Patient remained chest pain free. Cardiology was consulted, and patient was medically managed with a beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, and advised to follow up for an outpatient stress test.

Conclusions: The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include mid to distal anteroseptal and anterior akinesis/hypokinesis and basal to mid  inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis akinesis. The apex is not fully visualized but appears hypokinetic/akinetic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-12-21**], left ventricular systolic function is now significantly worse with new anteroseptal and anterior akinesis/hypokinesis. . EKG [**2188-2-6**]: Atrial fibrillation Ventricular premature complex Modest nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T abnormalities Anteroseptal myocardial infarct, age indeterminate - possible acute/recent/in evolution Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities Since previous tracing of [**2188-2-5**], further ST-T wave abnormalities present . Endoscopy: Findings: Esophagus: Lumen: A sliding small size hiatal hernia was seen. Mucosa: A salmon colored mucosa suggestive of Barrett's Esophagus was found. Biopsy not performed due to bleeding. Stomach: Excavated Lesions Multiple ulcers were found in the antrum and stomach body. A large 3-4 cm cratered ulcer with a necrotic center and adherent clot on the incisura was seen. There was a pulsating vessel seen after the clot was removed. Two resolution clips were applied to the vessel with persistent oozing. 9cc of 1:10,000 epinephrine was injected with successful hemostasis. Bicap thermal therapy was then applied to the area at the setting of 28. No bleeding was seen at the completion of therapy. Much of the body and fundus was not well-visualized due to blood and clot obscuring the view. Duodenum: Other lymphoid hyperplasia in the duodenal bulb. Other findings: An opening that is either a diverticulum or accessory duct was seen in the second portion of the duodenum. Impression: Ulcers in the antrum and stomach body Lymphoid hyperplasia in the duodenal bulb. Small hiatal hernia An opening that is either a diverticulum or accessory duct was seen in the second portion of the duodenum. Mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus   Brief Hospital Course: 84 yo male with PMHx sx for lymphoma, upper GIB, cardiomyopathy, who presented with an upper GI bleed with multiple gastric ulcers seen on endoscopy, likely secondary to NSAID use and recent high dose prednisone with CHOP therapy for lymphoma. Patient was also found to have a silent STEMI, with V3 elevation and elevated CE. . Upper GI bleed: Patient's UGI bleed was likely [**1-24**] NSAID use combined with recent prednisone for CHOP. Patient was transfused several units while in the MICU for hematocrit drop from 29.9 to 20.8 on presentation. Patient had an NG lavage performed, which did not clear after 1000cc NS were infused. An emergent upper endoscopy demonstrated ulcers in the antrum and stomach body, lymphoid hyperplasia in the duodenal bulb, and mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus. Patient's ulcers were clipped, injected with epinephrine, and had thermal therapy which stopped the bleeding. Biopsy wasn't performed at the time due to concern for increased bleeding. On transfer to OMED, patient was hemodynamically stable, but then began to have drop in hematocrit. He received three units of blood, without an appropriate increase in hematocrit. He remained guaiac positive, had two large bore pIVs for access, and continued on [**Hospital1 **] pantoprazole. He had serial hematocrits checked, and was stable for 48 hours prior to discharge. Patient was scheduled for outpatient endoscopy to reassess the ulcers, and for biopsy of the lymphoid hyperplasia. Patient was advised to avoid all NSAIDs. He will have serial hematocrits checked by home VNA. . STEMI: Patient was admitted with initial STE in V3, but with a progressive rise in cardiac enzymes. He was noted to have evolving ST changes since admission with peak troponin, and was diagnosed as having a STEMI. A cardiology consult was obtained, and recommended stopping patient's amlodipine and digoxin, and starting atorvastatin, lisinopril and metoprolol, which were started when patient was hemodynamically stable from a GI bleed perspective. Patient's cardiac enzymes were trended, and he was found to have continued upward trend in troponin to peak 2.24, with gradual decrease in CK and CKMB. Cardiology was reconsulted, and felt that elevation in troponin was not an indication for cardiac catheterization, and opted for medical management. Patient was not placed on heparin due to bleeding risk. He was not anticoagulated for his atrial fibrillation due to bleeding risk, and due to concern for poor compliance as an outpatient. A repeat echocardiogram was performed, which showed global hypokinesis and a depressed EF from 40% to 30-35%, possibly from stunned myocardium. He will need to have follow up with his outpatient cardiologist. He remained on telemetry with no events. He will need a stress test as an outpatient. He remained chest pain free through his admission. . Lymphoma: Patient's lymphoma was stable. He received one dose of neupogen as an inpatient, but had a leukocytosis. He will be seen in [**Hospital 20722**] clinic for consideration of further chemotherapy. Patient will be seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5565**] as an outpatient. . Patient remained full code. His diet was advanced as tolerated.

His wife witnessed him be struggling get out from bed, decline in his awareness. His wife spoke to him with appropriate condition around 6:05PM. Around 6:25PM, she heard that the patient started to say non-sence, act inappropriately, unable to exchange conversation. His wife recalled some ""shaking"" at the right arm. He was brought into [**Hospital1 18**] ED above time and Neurology was consulted for code stroke.  In ED, while Neurology was examining patient, he developed right arm, leg clonic seizure with head deviation and gaze deviation toward to left. He responded with moan when his name was called, then developed left arm clonic seizure (secondary generalization) and became unresponsive. Ativan 2mg IV was given to stop. Patient was intubated subsequently to have further neuroradiological evaluation.  HPI ADDENDUM: Further history was obtained from the patient's wife the morning following his admission. She reports the patient was well until returning from a same-day-surgical procedure on [**10-14**] for repair of left eye retinal detachment. The patient was vague with his reported symptoms, but complained of ""feeling lousy"" with poor appetite and fatigue. He did not eat or drink very much Friday or Saturday following. On Saturday evening he began to vomit quite frequently. They had a small breakfast Sunday morning and the patient was still feeling unwell, but altogether normal per his wife. She left for a few hours during the day, returned home and heard him yelling out of frustration after having dropped something in his room, however the yelling continued and she went to see him and noted that he had a great amount of difficulty getting himself upright to the edge of his bed. She then noted his right arm was shaking. He was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED where the above described event occurred.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 2809**] is a 58 year old gentleman s/p liver transplant related to chronic HCV infection, myopathy (? steroid induced), history of prior multiple asymptomatic embolic infarcts prior to transplantation, who presents with three day prodrome of general malaise, poor appetite, nausea/vomiting, followed by acute change in mental status with witnessed partial complex seizure in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  1) Neuro: * SEIZURE - Initially a code stroke was called in the ED, but CT imaging and later, MRI, showed no evidence of acute infarction. Initial labs notable for presence of only serum benzodiazepines on tox screening and acute on chronic renal failure. Etiology of seizure was thought to be areas of prior cortical infarcts in setting of gastrointestinal illness. The patient was intubated in the emergency department and promptly extubated at 2am in the Neuro ICU the same evening. The morning following admission the patient's examination was notable for marked encephalopathy. He was changed from phenytoin to oxcarbazepine (Trileptal) given multiple long term side effects of phenytoin, and with normal hepatic function, but renal impairment and keppra did not seem a wise choice. Lumbar puncture was attempted with light sedation without success. It was re-attempted with fentanyl and midazolam for monitored conscious sedation and revealed 1 WBC, 0 RBC, normal protein and glucose. He was transferred to the floor after an EEG done on the [**7-18**] revealed no abnormalities and showed a normal background. * ENCEPHALOPATHY - On the floor, the patient's exam was notable for continued encephalopathy, but he was evidently not delerious. His main abnormalities were frontal dysfunction (as exhibited by impulsiveness, stimulus-bound behaviors, desinhibition, bilateral grasp and palmomental reflexes, a marked inability to switch mindset) and memory (as exhibited by anososgnosia, orientation to place and time, as well as not imprinting new information, and working memory (the patient stayed in-task, and had sufficent attention to perform, but couldn't complete the tasks). Clinically he continued to improve slowly but surely, an EEG done on [**10-21**] showed 7 Hz background, but otherwise normal. Per his wife, his level of cognitive functioning at home was high, as for example he was able to discuss politics.  2) Cardio: * NSTEMI - Patient was noted to have elevated troponin enzymes to 0.31 with EKG without ischemic changes. He was started on aspirin, beta blocker, atorvastatin. Cardiology consultation was obtained and additionally recommended echocardiogram which revealed moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, no focal wall motion abnormalities (poor data quality though), LVEF>55%, mild aortic valve stenosis. His NSTEMI was thought related to demand related ischemia in the setting of catecholamine surge associated with seizure. He should be scheduled for an exercise stress test as an outpatient.  3) FEN * Acute Renal Failure - Patient's has prior hepato-renal syndrome now with baseline creatinine of 1.9-2. Admission creatinine notable for 2.4. He was noted to have low urine output. He received vigorous IV hydration with improved Cr to 1.6, however this was likely a sampling error because all the lines of his cellcount were down on this blooddraw as well, repeat labs showed a creat of 2.0 and his [**Hospital1 **] back to the old values. His medications were renally dosed. He was started on Thiamine, Folate and MVI.  4) Liver transplantation Transaminase levels on admission were WNL. Hepatology consultation was obtained and recommended continuing with his prior regimen of immunosuppressive agents. No changes were made.   5) ID A broad spectrum of CSF studies were sent despite the normal cell count. Varicella PCR and CMV PCR negative, remainder pending. MRSA isolation negative. VRE swab negative. Cryptococcal antigen GRAM STAIN, FLUID CULTURE, FUNGAL CULTURE-PRELIMINARY,ACID FAST CULTURE, VIRAL CULTURE were all (preliminary) negative.  6) PPx, reactivation and reconditioning For prophylaxis, he was put on Heparin, pneumoboots, TEDs, and PT and OT were consulted to evaluate and treat him.

No evidence of acute fracture. 2. Multilevel degenerative changes as described above. 3. Lung apices suggestive of edema, inflammatory, or small airways disease, vs infectious process. 4. 6mm peripherally calcified right thyroid nodule for which further evaluation with ultrasound. . EKG [**2128-2-13**] Sinus rhythm. The P-R interval is prolonged. There is a late transition with Q waves and ST-T wave changes in the anterior leads consistent with probable prior anterior myocardial infarction. There are tiny R waves in the inferior leads consistent with possible prior inferior myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing ST segment changes are new. . CXR [**2128-2-13**] IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. . R HIP FILMS [**2128-2-16**] FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-13**], views from the operating suite show placement of three metallic screws across the previously described fracture of the femur. . [**2128-2-16**] ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.  IMPRESSION: Markedly dilated right ventricle with severe global hypokinesis. At least moderate pulmonary hypertension. Small left ventricular cavity size with preserved systolic function. . [**2038-2-16**] CAROTID ULTRASOUNDS IMPRESSION: There is less than 40% stenosis within the internal carotid arteries bilaterally. . [**2128-2-17**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-16**], there has been a substantial decrease in the bilateral opacification, which had been more prominent on the left and could have represented either asymmetric pulmonary edema or diffuse aspiration. Some residual areas of opacification are seen at the right base laterally and at the left base. These most likely represent residual aspiration or possible atelectasis. . [**2128-2-18**] EKG Normal sinus rhythm with Q waves in the right precordial leads consistent with anterior wall myocardial infarction. Q waves in the inferior leads consistent with inferior myocardial infarction. Compared to tracing #2 there is no change.   Brief Hospital Course: 73F PMHx of DM, seizure disorder and breast cancer, found down on her floor with R hip fx s/p fall, admitted to the ICU with hip fx, ARF, NSTEMI, and hypoxia. Hospital course by problem:  # Elevated Cardiac Enzymes and EKG Changes: Had elevated troponins in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **] and new TWI both in the setting of anemia. [**Hospital **] medical regimen included ASA 81mg, statin 80mg daily, and beta blocker. ACE-I was held given recent acute on chronic renal failure and preserved EF as seen on echo (see below). . # Right Hip Fracture s/p Fall.  Pt was evaluated by orthopedics who planned for minimally invasive pinning procedure pending medical clearance, which was provided by daughter, [**Name (NI) 1785**], as pt was delirious. Went to OR on [**2128-2-16**], no complications intra-op, but did go back ot the ICU for overnight monitoring as she had some hypoxia postoperatively (had received a larga amount of morphine). She commenced PT POD#1, and was significantly limited by pain, but this improved by POD#3 (ay of d/c). She did receive narcotics around the time of PT to aid in progress.  Pain was also managed with tylenol. She was discharged on lovenox 40mg sQ daily for DVT ppx, and with orthopedic followup.  # Pancyopenia: Presented with acute on chronic anemia with baseline in low 30s, as well as thrombocytopenia with nadir platelets in the 40s, and leukopenia to a nadir of 2.1 Felt likely [**1-13**] methotrexate use with questionable use of folate (marrow suppressive process).  She was transfused 3 units in the ICU and on HD#2 had a stable Hct to 32.8.  DDAVP was given for low platelets. Her methotrexate was held, she received supplemental folic acid, and all cell lines recovered to normal by discharge. She will followup with erh rheumatologist for ? resumption of methotrexate.  # Acute Kidney Injury: Baseline creatinine = 1.3, but she presented with creatinine 1.8 -> max of 2.2 in setting of fall. Normal CKs made rhabdo unlikely. Felt likely [**1-13**] hypoperfusion and prerenal state.  Pt. was given IVF boluses and Cr decreased to 1.3 by discharge.  # Transaminitis: Had elevations of ALT, AST and Alk Phos without elevation in bilis. Unclear etiology, felt [**1-13**] mild ischemic liver in setting of hypotension. Her methotrexate was also held. LFTs had entirely normalized by discharge.  # IDDM: well-controlled by A1c.  FS were checked every 4 hours and she was placed on an insuling sliding scale.  Her lisinopril was held. On discharge,her metformin was continued, but lisinopril was still held in setting of recent acute renal failure.  # Fall: unclear etiology in pt with h/o seizure d/o and multiple CAD risk factors. Her cardiac enzymes were followed and Trop was trended from 0.16-->0.22-->0.22, so an MI could be the etiology but this could also have been a conseqeunce of her fall. Further syncope workup included monitoring on telemetry without significant arryhtmia, sending a tegretol level (normal), repeating EKGs (developed signs of MI), and carotid ultrasounds which were normal. Head CT and Cspine Ct in ED were negative.  # Hypoxia - pt still had minimal O2 requirement on d/c. Has known OSA per prior sleep evaluations. Also received many liters of IVF and 3 units of blood during her hospital course, so ? some element of hypervolemia, but phsical exam did not support this. Echo performed this admission revealed preserved EF of 60-65% but markedly dilated RV with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There was abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload. There was moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. This was thought to possible represent sequelae from her MI. Pulmonary embolism was on the differential but given her acute on chronic renal failure, a CT-A was deferred, and the patient was allowed to autodiurese and recover from the imediate postoperative period and wean off of narcotics. If persistent, this could be further worked up as an outpatient.  # RA:  methotrexate was held during admission given pancytopenia above.  # Depression: dx with mild depression - Effexor therapy was continued  # Dementia/Delerium: unclear circumstances of diagnosis, per record patient reporting forgetfulness, psych testing showing mild attention deficits.  She was continued on Aricept. She did experience significant delirium during her hospitalization which had improved by her discharge, but was still present in a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] nature but easily treated with reorientation and discontinuation of foley catheter, telemetry, and hydration. She does have followup scheduled with her cognitive neurologist.  # FEN: pt was seen by speech and swallow who recommended: 1. Continue current diet of thin liquids and puree. 2. Pills whole or crushed with puree. 3. 1:1 supervision for all POs. 4. Give POs ONLY when patient is most awake and alert. 5. Nutrition consult. 6. Recommend repeat swallowing evaluation at rehab prior to upgrading diet.  # Prophylaxis: will be on lovenox 40mg sQ daily until ealry [**Month (only) 547**] for DVT ppx, also d/c'ed on bowel regimen  # Communication: with patient and daughter [**Name (NI) **] HCP [**Name (NI) 1785**] [**Name (NI) 1356**] [**PO Box 103136**] [**Location (un) 2268**], [**Numeric Identifier 103137**]  Home: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 103138**] Cell: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 103139**] Work: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 103140**]  # Code: Full  # Dispo: To [**Hospital3 **]  Medications on Admission: Lipitor 20 mg daily Tegretol 200 mg TID Aricept 10 mg daily Lisinopril 5 mg daily Meloxicam 15 mg daily Metformin 500 mg daily Methotrexate 12.5 mg weekly Effexor 150 mg Daily   Discharge Medications: 1.

You were found after being down on the floor for a prolonged time. As a result of the fall, you suffered a fractured right hip, as well as low blood pressure which caused major stress to your heart and liver. Your hip fracture was surgically repaired, and as you were given IV fluids, the damage to your heart and liver improved substantially. You will need a course of rehabilitation and aggressive physical therapy to regain your previous level of function. . We also discovered that the right side of your heart is not working well, which will need to be worked up further by your PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the meantime we did discharge you with some supplemental oxygen to keep your oxygen levels at a healthy level. . Some changes were made to your medications, as follows: 1) Your methotrexate was STOPPED, since it might have been lowering your blood cell counts when you came to the hospital. The blood counts revcovered nicely when you were taken off methotrexate. You can determine when to restart this when you see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6426**] in followup. 2) Your lipitor was increased to 80mg daily 3) You will be receiving daily injections of lovenox, a blood thinner, to prevent blood clots after your hip surgery, for the next 25 days 4) START calcium and vitamin D supplements to help with bone healing 5) START metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] to protect the heart 6) START a baby aspirin every day to protect the heart  Followup Instructions: Orthopedics: Tuesday [**3-2**] at 11:20 with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Location (un) 8661**] Building, [**Location (un) **]) .

138089,"Admission Date:  [**2106-7-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2106-7-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2056-12-21**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 49-year-old gentleman with a known history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with an estimated ejection fraction of approximately 20%.  He had been accepted by the [**Hospital 4415**] heart transplant service and was at home listed as a status 2 awaiting cardiac transplantation.  On [**2106-7-4**] the patient had new onset chest pain and was admitted to the hospital where he ruled in for myocardial infarction.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Type 1 diabetes.  2. Known coronary artery disease status post multiple cardiac catheterizations. He is status post automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement.  He has ischemic cardiomyopathy.  3. Hypothyroidism.  MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1. Coreg 25 mg p.o. q.d.  2. Toprol 25 mg p.o. q.d.  3. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.  4. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.  5. Aldactone 12 mg p.o. q.d.  6. Synthroid 0.125 p.o. q.d.  7. Lantus insulin 25 q.d.  8. Humalog sliding scale subcutaneous insulin coverage.  ALLERGIES:  ACE inhibitor cause a cough.  HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where he was found to have significant multivessel coronary artery disease including a 30% left main and 99% left anterior descending coronary artery, totally occluded left circumflex and totally occluded right coronary.  His left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated at 13% at cardiac catheterization.  The patient was then referred to the cardiothoracic surgery service for assessment for coronary artery bypass grafting.  The patient subsequently preoperatively was managed on the cardiology service approximately [**2106-7-8**], was noted to have a dropping hematocrit and was sent for an urgent CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis to rule out a source of hematocrit drop.  He was found to have no intra-abdominal nor retroperitoneal hematoma at that time however it was noted that he had a pericardial effusion.  The patient also on [**2106-7-8**] underwent a myocardial viability study which showed diffuse uptake consistent with diffuse viability of left ventricular wall.  The patient remained on the cardiology service and was taken to the operating room on [**2106-7-12**] where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 4 by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  He had a LIMA to the LAD, saphenous vein to the RPL, saphenous vein to the D1, to the OM.  The patient had a preoperative intra-aortic balloon pump placed at the beginning of the case prophylactically due to his poor ejection fraction.  The patient did wean from cardiopulmonary bypass and his chest was being closed when he was noted to have significant problems with hypotension.  At that time it was felt appropriate to place him on a left ventricular assist device.  He was also placed on vasopressin, epinephrine, Levophed, and milrinone drips.  With the support of the left ventricular assist device and the pressors and inotropic agents the patient was successfully transported from the operating room to the cardiac surgery recovery unit in the evening of [**2106-7-12**] where he proceeded to wake up from general anesthesia.  He required some fluid resuscitation with blood products over the course of the first few postoperative hours and remained relatively stable on the support.  On physical examination at this time, neurologically the patient is sedated on propofol but is easily awoken, follows commands, nods his head appropriately and moves all extremities.  From a cardiac standpoint the patient has a blood pressure from 90 to 110s systolic with a mean arterial pressure of 65 to 70, presently on vasopressin, epinephrine, Levophed and milrinone drips.  He is on an left ventricular assist device, Abiomed BVAD 5000 I, with liter flows between 5 and 5.6 liters per minute.  His thermodilution cardiac output has also been in the 5 to 6 liter per minute range with an SvO2 of approximately 70%.  The patient's lungs are rhonchorous.  The patient has adequate oxygenation at this time.  His abdomen is soft, nontender.  His extremities are warm with minimal edema and he has positive Doppler signals in both of his feet.  Immediately postoperatively the patient's intra-aortic balloon pump was removed at the bedside.  Manual pressure was held for 35 minutes.  The groin looks good without signs of bleeding or hematoma and the pulse remains audible by Doppler in his balloon foot, which is the right.  CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  1. IV vasopressin drip at 0.8 units per minute.  2. Epinephrine 0.025 mcg per kg per minute.  3. Levophed 0.02 mcg per kg per minute.  4. Milrinone 0.5 mcg per kg per minute.  5. Propofol 30.  6.

[**2145-3-27**]: CT Abd/Pelvis: Wet read - Bibasilar aveolar infiltrates likely indicate pneumonia, possibly aspiration pneumonia.   Brief Hospital Course: 38 year old male with history of cerebral palsy, ulcerative colitis, previous aspiration pneumonias, here with influenza, aspiration pneumonia, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea.  ***FOLLOWUP: 1. Cdiff toxin B pending. Cdiff x2 negative on stool culture. Was treated with 10 day course of Flagyl IV during admission, and diarrhea did not change in frequency or quantity.  # Influenza/aspiration pneumonia: The patient presented with nausea and vomiting from influenza, and likely aspirated during this admission in this setting. On [**3-28**], he had an aspiration event and hypoxemia, and CXR showed LLL infiltrate from aspiration pneumonia. He was treated with Clindamycin and Levofloxacin, but he developed diarrhea. The patient has a history of colitis with Ciprofloxacin in the past per his mother, and Levofloxacin was stopped on [**4-1**], and Azithromycin was started. On [**4-1**], the patient developed stridor and worsening O2 saturation to the low 80s with minimal improvement on NRB. Although ENT found no airway edema, obstruction or tracheomalacia, the patient's respiratory status continued to worsen and he was transferred to the MICU and intubated.  He remained intubated for two days, on aztreonam and vancomycin (both started [**4-1**]). His weaning was complicated by agitation and tachycardia, which improved as lines/tubes were minimized. He was extubated successfully 2 days prior to transfer to the floor.  # Diarrhea: On [**3-31**], the patient spiked a new fever and developed antibiotic-associated diarrhea. His diarrhea continued, despite being maintained on flagyl x 6 days and cdiff negative x 2. Cdiff toxin B was still pending on the day of discharge.  # Dystonic reaction to Haldol: When he arrived to the floor after being in the MICU, he developed dystonia and partially fixing of his head turned to the left side, tongue thrusting movements, toe curling, arm and wrist bending. He had been given haldol 2.5 IV daily because he had been very agitated in the MICU. When he clinically improved, his signs did not change. He responded well to Benadryl 50 IV and Ativan 1 IV TID prn, with relief of dystonia within minutes. Benztropine was never given because of concern of exacerbating sinus tachycardia with HR 100-105 due to infection.  # Sinus tachycardia: His baseline HR is 80s per his mother, who is very involved in his care. His HR was consistently 100-105 during admission, despite fluid repletion and running of tube feeds and water flushes at home rate for 3 days before discharge. His HR should be rechecked as an outpatient, discussed with his mother. His mother stated that she was cancelling the patient's appointment with GI tomorrow because the patient greatly wanted to be home and away from hospitals, but she lives near a pediatrician friend who agreed to check the patient's vitals at his house this week. VNA was offered to the patient's mother and family, but they agreed to have the pediatrician see the patient in 3 days after discharge.  # Seizure Disorder: The patient was continued on Phenobarbital, level was therapeutic during admission.  # Cerebral Palsy: The patient was continued on Valium QHS for spasms.  # Ulcerative Colitis: He was continued on Asacol per outpatient regimen.  # GERD: He was continued on home regimen of PPI and H2-Blocker.

The basal-mid lateral wall contracts best. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.  IMPRESSION: Severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation with moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.   Brief Hospital Course: REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION: 75 F w CAD s/p RCA stent [**2116**], COPD, RA, seizure disorder, HTN, PVD, p/w several weeks of worsening SOB. Ruled in for STEMI at OSH & subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath.  ACUTE DIAGNOSES: # NSTEMI: Found to have peak troponin to 2.76 at OSH with T wave changes in V2-V5. Transferred on heparin gtt. Pt was continued on metoprolol, statin, ASA. Loaded with plavix prior to cath on [**2123-1-14**] which showed minimal in-stent restenosis of RCA stent, as well as a tight ostial LAD on which PCI could not be performed (too difficult). Pt had radial access for arterial cath; venous access in groin difficult to obtain. Patient hypotensive during case, requiring dopamine gtt temporarily (now off pressors). Afterward, patient developed rapidly expanding left groin hematoma. She was given protamine. Hematoma now stable, hematocrit 29 on discharge (stable for days). Patient also dyspnea, requiring O2 4L per NC, and appears somewhat volume overloaded. Patient admitted to CCU for diuresis and observation overnight. B/L LE US were negative for hematoma, non-contrast CT abdomen and pelvis were negative for RP bleed.  In the CCU, patient was continued on ASA 325mg PO, Atorvastatin 80mg PO daily, Metoprolol tartrate 50mg PO BID, plavix.  Amlodipine was discontinued and lisinopril was held due to hypotension/low urine output.  On the floor, patient started on diovan 40 mg, which should be held if her blood pressure is less than 100. Discharged on full ASA, plavix, metoprolol succinate 100 mg QD.  # LEFT GROIN HEMATOMA: Developed apparent right groin hematoma which was treated with protamine. CT [**Last Name (un) 103**] showed pt actually had left groin hematoma, none on right. No pseudoaneurysm/RP bleed. Hematoma and hematocrit remained stable throughout CCU & floor course. DPs dopplerable BL. Patient was maintained on pneumoboots instead of heparin sq prophylaxis.  # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: CXR showed pulmonary engorgement & bilateral effusions with compressive atelectasis. Pt was given IV lasix prior to going to the cath lab. A TTE was performed that showed severe global hypokinesis & akinesis of entire septum & apex.  LVEF 25-30%.  Prior ECHO shows EF 40-45% in [**2116**]. During catheterization, pt was hypotensive & required dopamine gtt.  She was transferred to the CCU for transient hypotension requiring dopamine in the catheterization lab. Ms. [**Known lastname 13143**] was normotensive on the floor. Diovan was started on the floor as above.  Lasix will not be reinitiated on discharge.  CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: # COPD/Emphysema: Pt was continued on her course of azithromycin. There was no concern for acute exacerbatin given good air movement & lack of wheeze.  # PVD: continued on aspirin & plavix.  # Seizure disorder: Last seizure was on [**2120**].  He was continued on home keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 **], but pharmacy recommended switching her dose based on her renal function.  The recommended dose (based on creatinine clearance) is 750 mg [**Hospital1 **].  This was explained to the patient as she was nervous about the change in dose.  # Rheumatoid arthritis:  He was continued on prednisone 5mg PO daily.  Her celebrex was held due to NSTEMI.  # Osteopenia:  He was continued on calcium, vitamin D.  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # Follow-Up:  Upon leaving rehab, the patient should schedule follow up appointments with her cardiologist (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) and her primary care doctor.  # Code Status: DNR/DNI.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 100424**] is a 78 year old gentleman with stage IV NSCLC admitted for lactic acidosis. . # Lactic acidosis: Anion gap of 15 on admission. During recent admission ([**6-28**]), no lactate was measured although AG ranged from [**1-2**] and bicarb 24-26 during admission with albumin >4. Differential includes type A lactic acidosis (hypoperfusion) from SIRS in setting of pneumonia or cardiogenic shock from ACS versus type B lactic acidosis from metformin/diabetes or active malignancy.  No evidence of liver mets or decreased synthetic function to suggest inability to clear lactate.  While in the ICU, the patient's metformin was held, venous lactate levels and anion gap were followed.  He received maintenence fluids.  His lactate was downtrending on transfer to the floor. . # Chest pain/CAD: Low suspicion for ACS given ECG in ED unchanged without ST-T wave abnormalities. CTA negative for PE and patient was CP free throughout his stay in the ICU.  His home meds including ASA, statin, lisinopril, and nadolol were continued. . # Leukocytosis: likely secondary to dexamethasone, WBC and fever curve were stable in ICU. . # Lung CA: Per primary oncologist, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**], Decadron was continued.  The patient received whole brain XRT while in the ICU, with plans to receive another dose the day after ICU discharge . # Ground glass opacities: Patchy ground glass opacities on CT present in 6/[**2174**].  Given heteregenous nature, unlikely to be edema.  Less likely to be blood, and low likelihood given clinical presentation for bacterial infection.  Given recent dexamethasone therapy, concern for PCP given lack of prophylaxis, although ground glass present prior to initiation of dexamethasone makes this less likely.  Pt was started on PCP prophylaxis with Bactrim . # COPD: Advair, tiotropium, and albuterol were continued. . # HTN: Home regimen of amlodipine and lisinopril was continued. . # Diabetes, type 2: Metformin given lactic acidosis and contrast load, pt was covered with ISS with accuchecks. . # Hypercholesterolemia: Statin was continued, ezetimibe held given lack of data regarding benefit. . # GERD: PPI Continued   Medications on Admission: Tylenol #3 [**1-21**] tab PO Q6-8 hours prn Albuterol INH Amlodipine 5mg PO daily Brimonidine 0.1% drops 1 drop each eye daily Escitalopram 20mg PO daily Ezetimibe 10mg PO daily Fenofibrate 145mg PO daily Fexofenadine-pseudoephedrine 120/60mg PO Q12 hours Fluticasone-Salmeterol 500/50 1 puff [**Hospital1 **] Ipratroprium INH 2 squirts daily Lisinopril 40mg PO BID Metformin 1000mg PO BID Nadolol 5mg PO daily Dexamthasone 4 mg PO Q6H Simvastatin 60mg PO daily Tamsulosin 0.4mg PO daily Tiotropium 18mcg PO daily ASA 81mg PO daily Omeprazole 20mg PO daily   Discharge Medications: 1.

A heart related cause was ruled out with testing, however another test showed that you had too much lactic acid. This is usually a seroius sign that your body is not getting enough oxygen. Thus, you spent a night in the ICU. It was discovered also that your blood sugar was far too high. Accordingly, your lactic acid may be the result of uncontrolled diabetes and the pill (metformin) you were using to treat it. We followed your labs and you gradually improved. At the same time, you were able to receive radiation therapy. . You were discharged with a new diabetes treatment regimen: NEW Lantus 20 units in the morning NEW Glypizide 5 mg twice a day NEW Bactrim - to prevent a lung infection when on steroids STOP Metformin HOLD Ezetimibe, Fenofibrate - discuss instead starting a statin (such as simvastatin) with your primary care doctor. Your sugars are elevated due to your steroids - once your steroids are decreased this diabetes regimen will need to be adjusted. Therefore it is very important to follow-up with your primary care doctor. Call your primary care doctor, [**Doctor Last Name **],[**Doctor Last Name **] S. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 14148**], for an appointment in [**1-21**] weeks for diabetes management. Take your blood sugar as directed by your primary doctor.

CXR [**12-29**]:  There are bilateral pulmonary opacities in the perihilar regions, left worse than right. This may represent some failure, bilateral infiltrates cannot be excluded.  ABD US [**12-30**]:  Right liver lobe hemangioma. Normal hepatic blood flow. Echogenic kidneys representing parenchymal disease.  CXR [**12-31**]:  1. No evidence of pneumothorax. 2. Worsening asymmetrical perihilar haziness, left greater than right, most likely due to worsening perihilar edema.  CT ABD/PELVIS [**12-31**]:  1. No evidence of a retroperitoneal hematoma. Small amount of simple free fluid in the pelvis. 2. Small bilateral pleural effusions. 3. Patchy consolidation in the left lower lobe could represent pneumonia. 4. Small pericardial effusion. 5. Probable small hemorrhage in the liver, consistent with recent biopsy.  [**12-31**] Liver transjugular biopsy: 1.  Acute submassive hepatic necrosis, centrolobular and mid-zonal areas (zones [**1-3**]). About 50% of liver is involved. 2.  Moderate lobular mononuclear cell inflammation with scattered neutrophils, and minimal portal inflammation. 3.  Mild cholestasis. 4.  Trichrome stain: No increased fibrosis. 5. Iron stain:  No stainable iron. Note:  Probable causes include drug/toxic and ischemic disease.  Transthoracic echo [**1-1**]:  Conclusions: 1. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. 2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. 3. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. 4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-2**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 5. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  Renal biopsy [**2109-1-4**]:  DIAGNOSIS: Renal Biopsy, needle: Advanced Global Glomerulosclerosis, Interstitial Fibrosis, and Tubular Atrophy, see note. Note: Light Microscopy: The specimen consists of renal cortex and medulla, containing approximately 6 glomeruli, all of which show advanced injury or global sclerosis. There is moderate to  marked interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. Patchy chronic inflammation accompanies the scarring. Arteries show moderate intimal fibroplasia. Arterioles show moderate-marked mural thickening, with hyaline change.  Immunofluorescence: Not done, as the tissue did not contain glomeruli (block exhausted).  Electron Microscopy (C4047) : Fine structural studies of  a single glomerular tuft with advanced injury reveal that most capillaries show obsolescence with loss of cellular elements. Extensive foot process effacement with areas of total podocyte loss are seen. Mesangial matrix is increased with occasional granular electron dense deposits. One loop is more preserved, and shows endocapillary cells with subendothelial electron dense deposits. No subepithelial deposits are noted.  Comment: Sample size is limited. Clinical correlation is indicated to determine if this small sample size is representative of the kidneys. The findings are that of advanced injury that cannot be specifically categorized..  CT ABD/PELVIS [**1-5**]:  1. Interval development of moderate-size perinephric hematoma as above. These findings were communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5716**] at the time of interpretation. 2. Stable appearance of small, bilateral pleural effusions. 3. Small amount of fluid surrounding the liver. Previously evident capsular hematoma is not well seen. 4. Moderate amount of free fluid is in the pelvis. 5. Marked circumferential edema of the gallbladder wall in the setting of luminal contraction, secondary to known underlying liver disease.   Brief Hospital Course: 50 year old female with history of HTN and nephrolithiasis, transferred from outside hospital with fulminant liver failure and acute on chronic renal failure, admitted to the MICU. Briefly, her liver failure had almost resolved by the time of discharge.  The etiology still remains unclear, though zithromax was felt to be the most likely cause.  Her renal failure continued, and she was discharged with anticipation of dialysis in the near future.  The cause of her renal failure also remains unclear.  1) Liver failure:  On admission, she was found to have transaminases in the 8000 range, as well as INR 3.8, PT 24.5, albumin 3.0, Total bili 9.2, and LDH 12,610. She was admitted to the MICU and followed by the hepatology team.  A number of blood tests were sent off to ascertain the etiology of her liver failure, however they were uniformly negative (these included tylenol, [**Doctor First Name **], CMV, EBV, toxoplasma, Hepatitis serologies, leptospirosis, and porphyria).  She underwent a transjugular liver biopsy on the 3rd day of the admission, which showed a non-specific pattern of injury consistent with drug/toxic or ischemic disease.  She unfortunately developed a subcapsular liver hematoma during the procedure, however this was stabilized with FFP and Vitamin K which the patient had already been receiving.  She also received 2 U PRBC, and hematocrit was subsequently stable.  A repeat abdominal CT scan later in the course demonstrated resolution of the hematoma.  She was followed by the transplant service, however she never met criteria for liver transplant (no encephalopathy), and liver function began to improve remarkably (see below).  During her hospitalization she received more than 14 units of FFP to keep her INR < 1.5, as well as DDAVP x 5, and multiple dosese of vitamin K.  Prior to discharge, her INR had remained < 1.5 on it's own for > 48 hours.  Her transaminases had trended down almost into the normal range (111 and 41 for ALT and AST respectively), and her total bilirubin had trended down to 5.9 from a peak of 40.3.  The etiology of the liver insult remains unclear, however the zithromax course that she had received is a potential [**Doctor Last Name 360**], and she should therefore not receive zithromax in the future.  The hepatology team felt that she would likely return to completely normal liver function.  2) Acute on chronic renal failure:  On admission she was also in acute renal failure with creatinine of 5.7.  By report from the outside hospital, her recent baseline Cr was 2.8 in [**8-4**]. Hepatorenal syndrome was in the differential, however her urine sodium was elevated, therefore this diagnosis could not be made. Initial urine sediment was felt to be consistent with ATN or AIN (RBCs, no acanthocytes, occasional WBC, hyaline casts, occasional renal tubular epithelial cells, granular casts, no muddy brown casts or rbc casts).  A renal US revealed echogenic kidneys consistent with parenchymal disease.  A later urine sediment showed many acanthocytic and dysmorphic rbcs, many casts, granular and bite stained, no WBCs, no RBC casts, occasional RTE cells, and 100 mg/dl protein.  The nephrology team felt that her acute insult had resolved, and the new sediment was suggestive of underlying glomerular injury, the possibilities for which included cryoglobulinemia, lupus, endocarditis, idiopathic MPGN, and post-infectious GN.  A renal biopsy was recommended.  Ms. [**Known lastname 59022**] had a renal biopsy on day 6 of her admission. Unfortunately there were only 5 glomeruli in the specimen, all globally sclerosed.  The interstitium was severely fibrosed, and there was tubular atrophy, all consistent with advanced injury that could not be specified.  Post-biopsy she developed flank pain, and was noted to have a hematocrit drop from 31 to 25.  A CT of the abdomen demonstrated a moderate-sized perinephric hematoma.  She again received FFP, DDAVP, and 2 U PRBC.  Her hematocrit stabilized and she had no further flank pain prior to discharge.  Her creatinine on discharge was still markedly above baseline at 6.1, and she was exhibiting mild signs of volume overload (orthopnea, peripheral edema).  The renal team did not feel that she met criteria for urgent hemodialysis, however, and she was therefore seen by the dialysis team and set up with outpatient follow up for probable need for dialysis in the near future.  Of note, her PTH prior to discharge was 369 (up from 15 only a few months prior).  She was also started on lasix at the recommendation of the renal team, with the hopes of improving her fluid  balance and controlling her hypertension (see below).  3) Pneumonia:  At the outside hospital she had been found to have a LLL PNA and was therefore already on levo/flagyl on transfer.  These were continued to complete a 7 day course.  She remained afebrile throughout her course.  Her wbc was elevated on admission, however this was felt to be related to the acute liver injury, and trended down throughout the admission.  She felt well throughout, and had no shortness of breath other than orthopnea from her fluid overload.  Her oxygen saturation was consistenly > 95%.  4) Hypertension:  She has a history of hypertension, and had been taking toprol XL 25 mg daily.  In the MICU she had very difficult to control hypertension, and was given metoprolol, hydralazine, and amlodipine.  A labetalol drip was started very briefly, for only a few hours.  On the floors, Mrs.[**Known lastname 59024**] blood pressure was moderately well controlled on metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **], and amlodipine 10 mg daily.  She was given lasix 40 mg PO once prior to discharge, and discharged on 80 mg PO daily, per renal, plus toprol XL 100 mg daily, and amlodipine 10 mg daily.  5) Anemia:  The patient had a persistently low hematocrit during the admission, however she also had an elevated LDH and persistent nucleated RBCs, therefore hematology/oncology was called. Review of peripheral smear was consistent with stress hematopoesis due to acute liver failure and not autoimmune hemolytic anemia.  They felt that her elevated LDH and bili, as well as low haptoglobin, were all a result of her liver disease. She likely has an underlying anemia of chronic disease from her renal failure.  Her hematocrit was stable between 30 and 32 prior to discharge.  Medications on Admission: Toprol XL 25 mg daily Prednisone x 2 days Flonase Robitussin   Discharge Medications: 1.

He was treated with antibiotics (Ceftriaxone), nebulizers, and admitted to medical service for further evaluation. Given concern for mass on initial CXR, he had a Chest CT [**2119-1-20**] that showed extensive lymphadenopathy. w/ lymphadenopathy of left axilla, mediastinum, and right hilum and celiac axis (worrisome for lymphoma). Course c/b fever to 101.4, leukocytosis with bandemia. Given concern for aspiration and history of MRSA, his antibiotic coverage was changed to Flagyl, Ceftazidime, Azithromycin, and vancomycin. On hospital day four, due to the patient's worsening shortness of breath, there was concern for superimpsosed congestive heart failure, and the patient received 40 mg IV lasix and nitropaste. However a CXR was without CHF findings and a BNP was normal at 73.

The patient was broadly covered with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, flagyl, and vancomycin. A CT was obtained [**2119-1-24**] that showed diffuse centrilobular opacities and apical ground glass attenuation with bilateral axillary and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The patient's eosinophils rose to 13%, raising concern for hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, or bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Legionella urinary antigen and HIV Ab tests were negative. LDH was elevated, which could be suggestive of PCP or lymphoma. PCP smear was negative X1 and sputum cultures grew only oropharyngeal flora. Pulmonary and thoracic surgery were consulted, and the patient underwent VATS on [**2119-1-26**] with biopsies of left upper and lower lung and left axillary lymph node. A PPD was placed, and was negative. ANCA and RF were negative. The patient developed worsening hypoxia and shortness of breath and required a MICU stay, though no intubation. He was started on IV steroids for his lymphadenopathy and worsening pneumonia. He was also continued on his Vanco, CTX, and Azithromycin. He had a CT scan to look for a PE and this found large b/lateral pulmonary emboli. A heparin gtt was started. In this CT scan, it was also noted that his infiltrates and lymphadenopathy improved, so steroids, abx were also continued. The patient improved his oxygen saturations and breathing and was transferred back to the floor. His chest tube had been removed without complication, including no pneumothorax, while he was in the MICU and 2 nylon sutures were removed from the site on [**1-31**]. After coming back to the floor, the patient did well and was on room air at discharge. His cultures from a BAL were all negative and after discussion with pulmonary team antibiotics were discontinued after 9 days of vanc, ctx, azithro. He was afebrile and his wbc was elevated (thought to be related to high dose steroids). Diff was normal.--tapering CCST  His VATS pathology came back and demonstrated 2 discrete morphologies affecting upper and lower lobes. In the upper lobes, the process appeared to be infiltrative dz of the alveoli, while lower lungs demonstrated bronchiocentric inflammation. Path was read as acute organizing PNA with neutrophilic predominence, likley viral/bacterial etiology. Pt's steroids were tapered down to 20 mg QD, which he will cont for 3 days, then will switch to 10mg QD for 5 days and then off. He will follow-up in pulmonary clinic on [**3-6**].  2) Chest wall hematoma- Pt c/o pain over LN bx site with tender mass and expansion over a 24hr period. U/S showed hematoma. His anticoagulation proceeded cautiously with heparin (goal PTT 50-70). His HCT remained stable and there was no significant expansion of the lesion, so he was bridged to coumadin (goal INR [**3-9**]). Thoracics recommended supportive and preventive interventions including elevation of the arm, ROM training, radial pulses, warm compresses, but felt there was no need to evacuate the hematoma. ...Pt may need IVC filter if conts to expand while on anticoags pt c/o of pain over the bx site. Pain was well controlled with IV dilaudid.  2) Chronic pain syndrome/LE neuropathy/LE ulcers: The patient was maintained on MS contin, hydromorphone, Neurontin, Flexeril. His ulcers appeared noninfected and superficial while the patient was in the hospital. These are chronic.  3) GI: The patient was continued on protonix throughout his hospital course for GERD. HepBSag and Sab were negative, HCV and HepB&C Ab were pending on discharge. Patient's LFTs were normal.  4) Hypothyroidism: Although the patient has no previous diagnosis of hyporthyroidism, TSH 11 and free T4 0.7. Levothyroxine 50 mcg PO daily was initiated. The patient will require follow-up TSH within 6 weeks following discharge.  5) Diabetes: The patient's fingersticks were very elevated after starting on IV steroids. He was started on insulin and then required some long acting for severe hyperglycemia. The patient had a Hgb A1C of 7.1. His glucose should come down as his steroids are tapered but he will have to be followed closely. He was maintained on RISS with QID fingersticks while in-house, but #######  6) PEs: Patient had bilateral PEs as discussed above. He was started on heparin gtt and bridged to coumadin once his chest wall hematoma was stable. Bilateral LENIs were negative for DVT and echo showed #####  7) Dispo: Pt will be going home with services, rather than to rehab,as he has used up all of his [**Hospital 103876**] rehab days. Prior to dispo, pt's PCP was updated on [**Hospital **] hospital course and need for close follow-up care.

Patient found to have ultrasound evidence of a full length right lower extremtiy DVT. . Mr. [**Known lastname 1794**] was admitted from [**2185-4-23**] - [**2185-5-1**] for left sided chest pain and was found to have bilateral PEs.  Patient was initially anticoagulated with heparin, which was transitioned to lovenox and warfarin.  Patient developed abdominal pain and was found on CT scan to have an intrahepatic hematoma with extravasation.  He was taken to IR, but no active extravasation was discovered and nothing was embolized.  He received 4 units PRBC with massive transfusion protocol and 1 unit platelets.  He received additional 2 units of PRBC on day 1 of MICU stay because of hypotension, which was attributed to hemorrhage. Transplant surgery was consulted and recommended conservative management of intrahepatic hematoma.  MICU course was complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation. As anticoagulation was contra-indicated given bleed, IR placed IVC filter on [**2185-4-25**].  Patient was discharged on no anticoagulation. . Today patient presented to his primary care doctor's office complaining of 4 days of right lower extremity pain with numbness in his leg and loss of sensation in his right foot. The pain is exacerbated by direct pressure on his foot. He notes pain extending from his mid calf until the top of his thigh. . Patient was sent to the emergency department. Initial vitals were T 97.9, HR 116, BP 124/85, R 20, O2 Sat 98% on 4L.  He triggered on arrival for a pulseless right foot. Initially the emergency department was concerned for arterial compromise. An ultrasound of the RLE showed evidence of a full RLE DVT. Vascular surgery was consulted and felt that the limb was non-threatened as patient had palpable right femoral, popliteal, and DP pulses and recommended anticoagulation when safe, elevation of RLE, and ACE wrap. . In ED patient also complained intermittent, vague abdominal pain. He had a CT Abdomen/Pelvis showing a stable liver hematoma.  The CT also showed the IVC filter with clot extending 2.2 cm above the filter in the IVC.  Patient was evaluated by transplant surgery who felt there was no role for surgical intervenstion adn the risk/benefit of anticoagulation in the setting of liver hematoma should be made by primary team. Patient received no medications or blood. He received 1.5 L of IVF.  On transfer vitals were T 100.1, HR 124, BP 138/98, RR 27, O2 sat 98RA. . On the floor, patient reports that he has leg pain from his right mid-posterior calf extending up though thigh to his right groin.  He has some mild numbness and tingling on the back of his right calf.  He denies abdominal pain unless someone presses down on his abdomen.  He denies chest pain, dyspnea, lightheadedness, syncope.  His abdominal pain is improved from his last admission.  Patient has noted recent weight loss and decreased appetite recently. Endorses fatigue and weakness. . Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.

Patient discharged home on recent prior admission with IVC filter, not on anticoagulation.  On this admission, patient found to have a large RLE DVT.  Patient with palpable peripheral pulses bilaterally.  Evaluated by vascular surgery in ED, who felt that his RLE was non-threatened and no surgical intervention was required.  Given the risk of extension of DVT to the point where vascular compromise could be reached, as well as the risk of further extending PEs, we cautiously anticoagulated the patient with careful monitoring for fear that the pt would patient have another hepatic bleed. Patient was admitted to ICU and anticoagulation was started with heparin gtt with goal of 60 - 80.  Patient reached the therapeutic level and his HCT remained stable.  Serial vascular exams were stable. The RLE was elevated and wrapped in ACE.  He was then sent to the regular medicine floor.  However, unfortunately he then had his platelets drop, and was found to have heparin induced thrombocytopenia (see below), and was transitioned to argatroban for his DVT.  He was then transitioned to coumadin prior to D/C. His INR was 4.0 on day of discharge, and he was instructed to follow up with his PCP for further monitoring of his INR with a goal of between [**2-3**]. . # Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia: Patient's platelets dropped from 247 on [**5-11**] to 118 on [**2185-5-14**], which normally would not fit with the traditional window for HIT, but pt had received heparin on his prior admission also.  Hematology was consulted, and recommended switching to argatroban, which we did.  Patient's PF4 test was sent, and returned with an optical density of 2.7, so the lab cancelled our serotonin release assay as the PF4 was considered positive enough.  Patient was instructed to get a heparin allergy bracelet with help from his PCP. . #  Recent subcapsular hepatic bleed: Patient with recent ICU stay requiring massive transfusion protocol following spontaneous subcapsular hepatic bleed while on anticoagulation. Patient discharged home from prior admission on no anti-coagulation.  For this admission, imaging showed that his liver hematoma had a stable appearance.  Surgery was consulted in the ED and recommended no surgical intervention at this time. Surgery recommended supportive care should the bleed recur, but patient remained with stable VSs and no RUQ abdominal pain. . # Bilateral pulmonary embolism: Patient initially presented with left sided chest and flank pain when admitted in [**2185-4-1**]. The etiology of emboli is unclear - patient was discharged with plan for outpatient hypercoagulable work-up.  Patient discharged with IVC filter, not on anti-coagulation.  Concern for extension of pulmonary embolism on this admission as clot extended proximally above IVC filter.  Patient remained mildly tachycardiac throughout the admission, but not hypoxic, dyspnic, and did not have chest pain.  Patient's PE's were treated with argatroban when his DVT was treated with argatroban.  HIT may have contributed to extension of clots above IVC filter. Patient will need outpatient anticoagulation w/u, but this is complicated by the fact that he is now on coumadin for at least 6 months. . # h/o [**Doctor Last Name 933**] disease: Previously followed by Endocrine at [**Hospital1 18**]. Per patient not receiving any treatment. Denies symptoms or hyper/hypothyroid at this time.  TSH was wnl therefore no intervention undertaken. . # Hypertension: Patient with history of hypertension, and was hypertensive on admission. Patient had not been taking lisinopril since discharge.  Lisinopril was held in the ICU while anticoagulating given bleeding risk, and patient remained normotensive there as well as when transferred to the floor. Therefore, we did not restart pt's lisinopril at dispo and instructed him to f/u with his PCP. . # Dyslipidemia: Simvastatin 10mg qhs held after last admission as patient had transaminitis likely [**2-2**] subcapsular liver bleed. LFTs were wnl.  Therefore we restarted simvastatin on this admission. . # Code: Full (discussed with patient)  PENDING LABS: None  TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES: Patient will need his INR monitored frequently until he is stably threapeutic between 2 and 3.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his new PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] and his office agreed to follow pt's INR.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 1794**], You were seen in the hospital for a blood clot in your leg. While you were here, it was determined that you have an allergy to heparin.  You should never be given heparin in the future. Please arrange with your PCP to have an allergy bracelet made so that you aren't given heparin.  You were put on an oral blood thinner called coumadin, that you will have to continue to take once a day until your doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) **] to stop taking it.  We made the following changes to your medications: 1) We STARTED you on COUMADIN (WARFARIN).  You will take 7.5mg on [**5-25**], then take 10mg once per day starting on [**5-26**] until Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] tells you to change to a different dose.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will follow your coumadin levels and adjust your dose of coumadin as needed.  If you have any questions, you should call him. 2) We STOPPED your LISINOPRIL because your blood pressure is already well controlled on no anti-hypertensive medications. Your PCP may tell you to restart this medication at some point.  If you experience any of the below listed Danger Signs, or any other new symptom, please call your doctor or go to the nearest Emergency Room.  It was a pleasure taking care of you.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 M with PMH EtOH abuse, IBS and depression, admitted from [**Hospital1 1680**] for management of EtOH withdrawal and concern for [**Hospital 90022**] hospital course complicated by [**Last Name (un) **].  ACTIVE ISSUES: # Alcohol withdrawal, concern for DTs, Adverse Drug Reaction - Patient was agitated on arrival and ataxic and there was concern that he was going into DTs, despite being on librium at the detox facility. In the ED he received 5mg Haldol for acute agitation.  He was admitted to the MICU for management of withdrawal and close monitoring. He was not tachycardic or hypertensive. In the MICU, he was treated with diazepam per CIWA scale (most recently [**Doctor Last Name **] ~5), as well as thiamine and folate (recently transitioned to PO). Non-contrast head CT (for eval given falls) showed no ICH.  After transfer to the floor, patient was calm and appropriate, with little memory of what had brought him to the hospital; he felt that his what had been described to him was not consistent with his character. Psychiatry was consulted to evaluate whether bizarre behavior at [**Hospital1 1680**] may have had an alternative explanation.  Consult theorized that patient's presentation was more consistent with benzodiazepene intoxication than alcohol withdrawal.  # Acute Renal Failure due to Dehydration: Initial Cr was 1.8, but improved to 1.0 on second chem panel without any intervention.  CHRONIC: # Depression: Patient reported history of depression, which was impetus for him to resume excess alcohol consumption.  He denied depression during this admission.  He was provided with resources by SW. Psychiatry evaluation was performed who felt he was completely safe to discharge, and was not particularly depressed at this time. No SI/HI.  # thrombocytopenia/Anemia: likely EtOH induced marrow suppression given h/o etoh abuse, elevated MCV. Stable throughout admission  # Benign Hypertension: No acute exacerbation of chronic issue, pt. was continued on home dose of amlodipine.  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # Caution with benzodiazepenes during withdrawal. # Recommended to have close follow up for depression.  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete. Information was obtained from Patient. 1. Amlodipine 5 mg PO DAILY   Discharge Medications: 1.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],  You were transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] from [**Hospital 1680**] Hospital for concern that you were behaving abnormally. You were treated for alcohol withdrawal, which may have contributed to your symptoms. You were given benzodiazepines, intravenous fluid and vitamin supplementation. During this hospitalization, you returned to behaving like your normal self. You were seen by the psychiatry team who believe that your abnormal behavior may also have been in part due to side effects from the medication used to treat your alcohol withdrawal.  You complained of anxiety while in the hospital. We have given you a 3 day prescription for an anti-anxiety medication to treat your symptoms until you can see your primary care physician who will take over management of your anxiety.  MEDICATION CHANGES: START-lorazepam (Ativan) 0.5 mg by mouth as needed for anxiety, up to one every 8 hours.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 69 year-old female with past medical history of coronary artery disease status post MI with stent to RCA in [**2165**] presents from outside hospital after ruling in for myocardial infarction.  The patient transferred here for cardiac catheterization.  1.  Cardiac -  Coronaries the patient with known disease, increased Troponin and index at outside hospital with EKG changes all suggestive of acute coronary syndrome.  At presentation the patient was chest pain free times three days.  The patient was originally continued on Heparin, Aggrastat, beta blocker, aspirin, statin and Gemfibrozil. Plendil was discontinued in favor of starting an Ace inhibitor.  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2171-4-16**] and this showed one  vessel coronary artery disease. The patient underwent successful stenting of 95% mid RCA stenosis.  Ejection fraction was preserved.  The patient suffered from no flow phenomenon requiring Diltiazem and Nitroglycerin secondary to chest pain and ST elevations with stent deployment. The patient also suffered complete heart block secondary to Diltiazem in cath lab requiring transient pacer.  The patient was transferred to the CCU with chest pain and persistent ST elevations. Aggrastat was stopped prior to catheterization secondary to epistasis and guaiac positive stools.  In the cath lab the patient stabilized on Nitro drip. Complete heart block resolved and pacing wire was taken out. The patient was transferred to the floor without chest pain and with complete resolution of EKG changes to continue medical management.  The patient had no further episodes of chest pain throughout her hospital stay.  The patient's Ace inhibitor was changed to Lisinopril for two day dosing.  The patient continued on Gemfibrozil and Fluvastatin for cholesterol and was to complete a 30 day course of Plavix.  Estimated ejection fraction at cardiac catheterization was 60%.  2.  Hematocrit - The patient with a hematocrit drop peri catheterization thought to be secondary to anticoagulation. The patient received three units of packed red blood cells. The patient hematocrit low was 26.[**4-22**].  ON day of discharge [**2171-4-21**] the patient's hematocrit bumped to 39.1.  3.  Infectious Disease - The patient had a temperature spike to 101.2 F the evening of [**4-18**].  The patient was started on Bactrim for mildly positive urinalysis which consisted of large blood, small leukocytes, negative nitrites, 5 whites, moderate bacteria, one squamous epithelial cell.  The patient had received temporary Foley catheter in the CCU and complained of mild urinary burning after its being taken out.  The patient defervesced over the next few days but had a low grade temperature on the evening of [**2171-4-19**]. The patient was changed to Ciprofloxacin and chest x-ray was unrevealing. Blood cultures were drawn which showed no growth to date at the time of discharge.  The patient to be followed as an outpatient and instructed to take her temperature and if over 100 to seek medical attention. The patient to complete a seven day course for UTI. Urine culture was uninterpretable due to fecal contamination.

Small right pleural effusion has probably developed. Lungs low in volume but clear. Moderate cardiomegaly unchanged. Healed right lower and lateral rib fractures.   Brief Hospital Course: Summary of Injuries sustained: anterior right 2-7th rib fractures, right hemopneumothorax, bilateral pulmonary contusions, L zygomatic arch fracture, left lateral pterygoid plate fractures, left lateral orbital wall fractures, left minimally displaced orbital fractures, nondisplaced lamina papyrica fracture, right orbital floor fracture, bilateral lateral wall maxillary sinus fracture, right ear skin avulsion.  Review of Systems:  Neurologic: Patient was neurologically intact. He recieved dilaudid IV prn during his ICU stay, he was then transitioned to PO pain medication. At discharge he was not requiring pain medication.  Opthalmology assessed patient to assess visual status following displaced orbital fractures.  Plastic surgery assessed facial fractures and as patient is refusing surgery, they will follow up with him as an outpatient. For his facial fractures he was placed under sinus precautions and is restricted to a soft diet.Neurosurgery assessed patient for his dens fracture and it was determined that his fracture resulted from an injury 20 years ago when he dove into a pool. On hospital day 6 he was triggered for altered mental status after receiving valium.  Standing zyprexa was administered with return to baseline mental status without further incidient.  He requires no further neurosurgical follow-up for his dens fracture.  Cardiovascular: Following transfer to the ICU patient remained hemodynamically stable.  He suffered an intial period of hypotension in the emergency room but after resuscitation he was hemodynamically stable.  Pulmonary: A chest tube was placed for hemopneumothorax in the ED. The chest tube was discontinued on HD6. There was a small increase in pneumothorax upon discontinuation, however follow up CXR revealed this change to be stable. His respiratory status was stable.  While in the ICU, he was monitored for respiratory decompensation due to splinting from his rib fractures, however his respiratory status remained stable and he did not require an epidural for pain control.  GI: Patient suffered no intraabdominal injury. He tolerated a soft diet without issue. He was restricted to a soft diet due to his facial fractures.  GU/Renal: Patient has a foley catheter placed while in the ICU but it was discontinued when he was transferred to the floor. His electrolytes were repleted as necessary. His creatinine remained stable.  Endocrine: He was placed on insulin sliding scale while in the ICU. At discharge sliding scale had be discontinued and patient was no longer requiring insulin. A right thyroid nodule was noted on CT and needs to be followed up with ultrasound as an outpatient,  Heme: Patient underwent serial hematocrit checks which trended down slowly. He received one blood transfusion while in hospital, after which he required no further transfusions as his hematocrit was stable.  He was placed on SQH for DVT prophylaxis.  Skin: Patient right ear laceration was repaired primarily by plastic surgery. He was placed on levofloxacin, which following treatment course, was discontinued.

Dilatation of the proximal CBD. 3.  Prominent periportal lymphadenopathy, nonspecific. . CxR [**10-31**]: New perihilar pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions. . ERCP [**10-31**]: Ccannulation of the common bile duct.  Cholangiogram demonstrates a normal caliber of the common bile duct and intrahepatic ducts.  The cystic duct is also filled with contrast, partially opacifying the gallbladder.  No strictures or filling defects are identified.  Following cholangiogram, there is placement of a plastic stent within the common bile duct. . CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis [**10-31**]: 1.  Multifocal pulmonary opacities, which could represent an infectious process. 2.  Bilateral axillary and right hilar lymphadenopathy, all could be related to the underlying infectious process. 3.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions. 4.  Although there is ascites, fluid within the lesser sac and adjacent to the pancreatic head raises the suspicion of pancreatitis. 5.  Splenomegaly. 6.  Periportal lymphadenopathy. . Echo [**11-1**]:  No evidence of endocarditis. Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation. .

Concern was for VAP given increased respiratory secretions vs recurrent pancreatitis with pseudocyst as pancreas enzymes were rising after recently having restarted TF.  CT Abd/pelvis was without evidence of worsening radiographic pancreatitis.  Other sources considered included line infections (Right IJ recently replaced in same site) or C. diff given prolonged ABX course. . Extensive prior infectious workup had revealed a positive EBV IgM, EBV PCR, and EBV PCR in CSF.  Given pancyotpenia, splenomegaly, and EBV infection Heme/Onc and ID were considered the diagnosis of Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis, which was confirmed by repeat bone marrow biopsy (first biopsy unremarkable).  Pt was begun on etoposode, IVIG and decadron on ~[**11-7**].  His pancytopenia was also treated with epogen and neupogen. . Per HEME, HLH likely triggered by underlying EBV infection. While there was evidence of EBV in the CSF; because of normal Protein no need for IT-MTX.  The patient was started on a steroid taper (currently on 10 mg Decadron) and will need 8 weeks total of Etoposide.  Renal failure, pancreatic abnormalities, and elevated LFTs all thought to be d/t underlying HLH.  In addition, ID consults did not recommend treating EBV viremia with anti-virals. . On [**11-9**], pt was noted to have EBSL klebsiella in a sputum and BAL sample, and was begun on meropenem for 14 day course. He continued to develop low grade temperature (100.0-100.6), which were attributed to his HLH, IVIG, and CVVHD. . #  Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated on [**2118-10-30**] for impending respiratory distress at time of his ERCP.  Upon admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**11-7**], his respiratory mechanics had improved considerably, and he was oxygenating and ventilating well on PS 5/0.  Initially unable to extubate secondary to altered mental status and increased secretions.  Pt was often desyncrhonous on vent secondary to hiccups when sedation weaned.  As mental status improved gradually, pt was extubated on [**11-10**].   His respiratory status continued to improve slowly, despite +BAL for EBSL klebsiella and total body fluid overload, and on [**11-14**] pt was sat'ing >95% on RA. . # Mental Status - pt presented to [**Hospital1 18**] alert & oriented, however his mental status subsequently declined.  After intubation on [**10-30**], pt remained largely sedated until just prior to admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**11-7**].  Attempts to wean sedation were limited by hiccups which resulted in dysynchrony the mechanical ventilation, breif neuro exam at time of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission with sedation weaned revealed pt responsive only to deep painful stimulus (sternal rub),  pupils minimally reactive to light bilaterally, gag was present, with slow corneal reflex. +hyperreflexia, though tone was flacid, and 5-10 beat clonus of both feet was noted which initially worsened to 20 beat clonus on [**11-11**] before slowly improving. . Was seen by the neurology/psychiatry services given his new neurological findings and h/o myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] (which predominantly was ocular per pt's family).  EEG was obtained which showed diffuse slowing, but no focus of seizure activity. CT head on [**11-7**] unremarkable. Over the course of his first week in the [**Name (NI) 153**], pt's mental status improved dramatically, presumably with chemotherapy.  By [**11-14**] pt was alert, pleasantly conversive, and following all commands.  His imuran for myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] has been held since admission.  Neuro also noted proximal weakness of his arms, which improved during his hospital course.  Per Neruo, he should hold Imuran until he follows up with Neuro as an outpatient. . # Renal - pt without h/o CRI, developed ARF likely secondary to ATN from hypotension and underlying HLH on [**11-1**].  Pt was started on CVVHD at that time for volume overload [**2-17**] anuria, however, UOP gradually improved, and on [**11-15**] pt was discontinued from HD.  Creatinine normal on discharge. . # Cholestasis/hepatitis/pancreatitis - pt presented to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH with RUQ pain, fever, and elevated LFTs (Tbil 7's), for which he underwent ERCP with CBD stent on [**11-2**].  LFTs have since trended down, though amylase/lipase (peak in 1000s) were starting to plateau at 500s on [**11-14**].  CT abdomen showed pancreatic fluid collection, but not psuedocyst or necrosis.  On [**11-13**] pt denied abdominal pain, and was hungry, thus was transitioned from TPN to TF cautiously, as prior attempt to restart tube feeds was limited by bump in amylase/lipase.  On [**11-14**], pt was tolerating TF without difficulty, in addition to sips of clear liquids, thus he was advanced to a regular diet after a speech & consult was obtained. On the floor, he tolerated his diet without other clinical s/sx of pancreatitis. . Psych:  thought the patient had a mild encephalopathy that was slowly resolving.  Recommeded Haldol/Seroquel for sleep; however, this made the patient feel strage.  Given resolution of MS changes, ok for patient to receive ambien at rehab prn. .

He states this came on suddenly. The primary trouble is with finding words to describe what he wants to say, not actually articulating the words. He denies any other neurologic symptoms, including weakness (no stumbling, dropping items), loss of sensation, or other confusion. Mr. [**Known lastname **] displays understanding of his current situation and location. He denies any specific symptoms, including fever/chills, headache, shortness of breath, chest pain/pressure, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea/constipation, melena/hematochezia, dysuria/hematuria, nosebleeds, and rashes. Hhis speech prompted the team in the clinic to investigate these symptoms, and an MRI/MRA demonstrated a left parietal fluid collection.  In terms of his AML, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was treated with LODAC in [**2182**] and subsequent to that has been on hydrea and donazol and has been transfusion dependant.  He is currently on hydroxyurea only.  Past Medical History: 1.)AML, converted from MDS 2.)DM-2 3.)COPD   Social History: Mr. [**Known lastname **] lives alone.  His sister lives about one block from him and is very supportive.  He uses [**Company 107361**] the ride to get to his [**Hospital1 107362**] clinic visits.

On the second day of admission, he experienced a sudden, severe headache and had a stat head CT, showing no definite change in the size of the lesion or the degree of midline shift, yet due to his symptoms, neurosurgery was consulted.  They felt it appropriate to take Mr. [**Known lastname **] to the OR where the subdural bleed was drained; subsequent pathology demonstrated clotted blood.  He was kept in the neurosurgical ICU for two days where he did well with no post-operative complications and was then sent back to the bone marrow unit for further care.  By his return to BMT, his speech and confusion had greatly improved, and his family members agreed that he was back to his baseline. Throughout the remainder of the admission, he continued to experience a slight headache, much improved from admission, that was well relieved by 5mg of oxycodone.  His word-finding symptoms did not recur. The main challenge was maintaining his platelets at a an appropriate level due to his underlying myelodysplastic syndrome.  Per the neurosurgery team, his goal for platelets was around 50 for three weeks; at the time of discharge, he will require an additional week of platelets at this level, usually achievable by giving two bags of platelets each morning, checking a post transfusion count 30-60 minutes thereafter. After this week has finished, he will be maintained at his prior level, getting transfusion two to three times per week at [**Hospital1 1388**] hematology clinic under the care of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**].  He will follow-up with his hematologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**], for his AML in one week and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**], a neurosurgeon, in two weeks (he will get a repeat CT scan at that time).  2.)AML -- Mr. [**Known lastname **] is being treated with hydroxyurea and transfusions as needed.  His WBC at [**Hospital1 18**] ranged between 12 and 28, generally around 14.  His goal hematocrit was over 25, and he generally required one unit of packed RBC's every three to four days.  Platelet requirements have been described above.  3.)Type two diabetes -- The prednisone Mr. [**Known lastname **] takes makes his blood sugars somewhat difficult to control, however, a regimen of Humalog 75/25 with 45 units every morning and 25 units at night seemed to work the best.  He was also covered with a routine regular insulin sliding scale for excessively high values (usually starting at 2 units of regular insulin for a glucose of 150-200, and going up by two units of insulin for every 50mg/dl of blood glucose increase).  4.)COPD -- Mr. [**Known lastname **] was maintained on Advair 250/50, one puff twice a day.  He was also given an albuterol inhaler for shortness of breath/wheezing that he rarely needed.  He became wheezier in the middle of the admission, and was given twice daily scheduled albuterol nebs to which he responded well.  We would recommend continuing these for two more days, then stopping them, leaving him on only Advair and as needed albuterol inhalers.  5.)Fever -- One week prior to discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a temperature to 101.  His blood and urine cultures were negative. Clinically and radiographically, his most likely source was pulmonary, although the chest x-ray did not demonstrate an obvious pneumonia.  He was treated with levofloxacin, and will finish his course with seven more days of antibiotics.

[**10-29**]: Operation Performed: Flexible colonoscopy to 60 cm.   History of Present Illness: This is a 66-year-old gentleman who has a known large abdominal aortic aneurysm.  It has now grown to 8 cm in size.  He has multiple comorbidities; however, he has been cleared for surgery by cardiology after cardiac catheterization.  He has a suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm which is notamenable to endovascular repair.  he has a single kidney (left) with a stent in the origin which comes off the aneurysm and will require bypass.  In addition, he has bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms with a very large (5cm) right common iliac aneurysm which will require extension of the graft into the iliac bifurcation.  Given his risk for rupture, the patient was consented for an open aneurysm repair  Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. CAD RISK FACTORS: DM2, HTN, dyslipidemia, CAD, smoking 2.

No cyst or stone or solid mass is seen in the left kidney.  DOPPLER EXAMINATION: Color Doppler and pulse-wave Doppler images were obtained from the left kidney only. Note is made that this is a limited Doppler study due to the portable technique and the patient's body habitus.  Arterial flow is documented within the left main renal artery, but cannot be further assessed. Venous flow is seen in the main renal vein. Resistive indices are mildly elevated measuring 80, 79, and 73.  IMPRESSION: 1. Arterial and venous flow identified within the left kidney with mildly elevated resistive indices in the intraparenchymal arteries. No further assessment can be made at the main renal artery due to the limited nature of this portable technique and the patient's body habitus. 2. Atrophic right kidney.   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 17353**],[**Known firstname **]  was admitted on [**10-27**] with AAA. He agreed to have an elective surgery. Pre-operatively, he was consented. A CXR, EKG, UA, CBC, Electrolytes, T/S - were obtained, all other preparations were made.  It was decided that she would undergo a:  Open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm and bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms with a Dacron 20 x 10 bifurcated graft as well as a bypass to the left renal artery.  He was prepped, and brought down to the operating room for surgery. Intra-operatively, he was closely monitored and remained hemodynamically stable. He tolerated the procedure well without any difficulty or complication.  He was transferred to the CVICU for further care. He had a prolong intubation. [**2167-10-27**] - [**2167-11-5**]. He received mo niter care and pressure support.  During this time frame pt had ATN. His nephrotoxic drugs were held. He received PRBC for hypotension and volume support. His baseline creatinine was 1.6, High 4.6, now 2.1. All his home meds were restarted. He always maintained good urine output.  Pr also had Bowel movements in the immediate post operative period. transplant was called. Had mucosal sloughing. His lactate was normal. This is assumed resolved.  Pt had hypernatremia to 147. This resolved with fluids.  After he was extubated he was then transferred to the VICU for further recovery. While in the VICU he received monitored care. When stable he was delined. His diet was advanced. A PT consult was obtained. When he was stabilized from the acute setting of post operative care, he was transferred to floor status  On the floor, he remained hemodynamically stable with his pain controlled. He progressed with physical therapy to improve her strength and mobility. He continues to make steady progress without any incidents. He was discharged to a rehabilitation facility in stable condition.  To note his staples were removed on DC. Steri strips are in place.  PT HAS RUL OPACITY ON CXR. HE NEEDS TO HAVE THIS WORKED UP.

The patient's history this year has been marked for starting amioadarone in [**Month (only) 958**] for persistent atrial fibrilllation (also had TEE and cardioversion) and had stayed in sinus rhythm. Unfortunately, in [**Month (only) **] the patient developed worsening cough and dyspnea and her amiodarone was stopped due to concern for early pulmonary toxicity.  On [**9-23**] the patient was admitted to [**Location (un) **] Hospial with worsening respiratory symptoms, including dyspnea, cough, and hypoxia.  She had a chest CT on [**9-25**] that revealed diffuse GGO on a background of bronchiectasis and emphysema.  She started empiric treatment with abx and steroids for concern of AIP.  Given progressive respiratory failure she was intubated.  At the time of bronchoscopy she had bloody secretions and there was concern for pulmonary hemorrhage.  Therefore she was taken off anticoagulation.  She was continued on antibiotics (amp-sublactam and azithromycin) and steroids, her anticoagulation was stopped, and she was also diuresed gently to keep steadily negative fluid balances.  She had mild improvements and was extubated on [**10-2**].  Unfortunately, since extubation she had progressive supplementary O2 requirements and spent the last few days prior to transfer bouncing between 100% NRB mask and CPAP. She has had no positive cultures and bronchoscopy revealed no organisms and no pathognomonic findings for a particular diagnosis.  OSH course was also notable for persistent and difficult to control afib with RVR so that on transfer she was on high doses of diltiazem, metoprolol, and digoxin.  Given her ? pulmonary hemorrhage the patient's primary pulmonologist strongly felt she should not be anticoagulated again and wanted transfer partially to pursue AV nodal ablation or other more advanced RVR management by our EP service.  On arrival, vital signs were 96.1 (axillary), HR 88 (afib), 131/65, and satting 95% on non-rebreather. The patient was awake, alert, responding appropriately to questioning. Reports that her breathing is ""a little labored,"" but feels better than she had at the OSH.  Past Medical History: - Cardiomyopathy after chest contusion with former EF 30%, now normalized at 55% - CAD, s/p BMS to RCA in [**10/2181**] - Upper lobe bronchiectasis attributed to severe pneumonias in the [**2132**]. Typically has 2-3 episodes of exacerbation bronchiectasis each year. - COPD with moderately severe centrilobular emphysema on CT - Hypertension - T2DM - Mitral Valve Prolapse - R breast nodularites (stable on subsequent mammograms) - Plantar Fasciitis - s/p partial hysterectomy in [**2142**] - Bladder suspension - GERD - Multinodular goiter  Social History: Former smoker, x 30 years at about two packs/day. Stopped seven years ago. Occasional social alcohol. Lives at home alone, is independent in ADLs. Two children are involved in her health care.  Family History: There is a family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death (three brothers who died of CAD and one sister with CHF).

This may represent an acute process superimposed on background chronic changes. The differential diagnosis includes drug-related pneumonitis (by report, the patient is on amiodarone), interstitial edema, and interstitial infection. Edema is considered less likely given the absence of effusions.  Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasounds [**2183-10-11**]: IMPRESSION: Bilateral lower extremity DVTs, more extensive on the right involving the common femoral vein, proximal and distal superficial femoral veins and posterior tibial and peroneal veins. Partially occlusive thrombus within the distal left superficial femoral vein.  Brief Hospital Course: 80 y/o F with likely emphysema and bronchiectasis as well as Afib w/ RVR and history of cardiomyopathy presenting with worsening respiratory symptoms and hypoxia in the context of bilateral ground glass infiltrates of uncertain etiology.  Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient presented with very high oxygen requirements and desatting with minimal exertion or very short periods off the high flow oxygen masks. Unclear ultimate etiology though diffuse findings on CT were thought to be concerning for AIP on baseline lung disease with pulmonary hemorrhage thought much less likely given reports of bleeding. Patient had already received a fairly high pulse of steroids leaving the benefit of another course questionable but given tenuous respiratory status limiting ability to perform further diagnostic work-up (particular any attempts to pursue tissue diagnosis) a dose of 1 gram methylprednisolone daily was initiated for three days followed by 1 mg/kg daily. She was also started on vancomycin and cefepime given neither vancomycin nor psuedomonas had been covered by here previous antibiotics and those could be established in her altered airways as a not uncommon cause of pneumonia.  Also patient was found to have DVT's as described elsewhere, which were treated in hopes of helping hypoxia.  Patient received levalbuterol and ipratroprium nebulizers.  Eventually a bronchoscopy was done and did not show evidence of pulmonary hemorrhage.  However, the patient's oxygenation became more and more problem[**Name (NI) 115**] and she was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Her ventilator requirements continued to escalate.  Intracranial hemorrage:  While on a heparin drip for DVT, the patient was noted to have anisocoria.  Head CT revealed large parenchymal hemorrhage apparently centered in the right corona radiata or that caudate nucleus, with transependymal dissection into both lateral ventricles, and the third and fourth ventricles.  The patient's  poor prognosis was explained to her family.  The decision was made to pursue comfort measures only.  Deep Vein Thromboses: On presentation given patient's refractory hypoxia an lack of good options decision was made to pursue some work up for VTE given she was thought to be too unstable for CT Scan but this could contribute to hypoxia.  Lower extremity ultrasounds revealed DVT and she was started on heparin gtt. Presumably, DVT's were developed during OSH course after warfarin was stopped.  Atrial fibrillation: Patient was well rate controlled at arrival on dilt 90 QID, metoprolol tartrate 50 TID and dig, given some pauses (2-2.5 seconds) on the night after admission and generally good rate control. Later in her course her rate became more rapid and she briefly requiring diltiazem gtt.  Heparin drip was continued as above.  CAD, Cardiomyopathy: Patient had an EF of 30 with a cardiac contusion per past reports but now normalized to 55.  Echo showed normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function and biatrial enlargement. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertensionShe was continued on her aspirin, simvastatin, and beta blocker for her history of CAD. . Hypotension: Initially normotensive on rate control agents. Also on daily furosemide.  On the day of intubation, she also became hypotensive requiring initiation of norepinephrine . Diabetes Mellitus Type II: Mildly hyperglycemic on arrival.

PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - Mrs. [**Known lastname 13755**] initially presented [**2143-9-2**] with abdominal  pain. At that time, she was found to have a large mass in her abdomen. - On [**2143-9-6**], she underwent an incomplete resection of this tumor. It was found to be increasing in size and she was treated  on Gleevec from [**1-/2145**] to 12/[**2146**]. At that time, she stopped it  as she was having some side effects from this therapy, most notably severe cramping. On the Gleevec, her tumor had decreased  in size. However, the mass grew while she was off the Gleevec and she was restarted on it again in 07/[**2149**]. She was restarted  at 200mg daily to avoid issues with cramping. - On [**2151-6-29**] she had a CT scan which showed new liver lesions which were concerning. An ultrasound was obtained [**2151-7-13**] which  showed these lesions and raised concern for metastatic disease.  - She was increased from Gleevec 200mg daily to 400mg daily on [**2151-9-8**]. - She had stable CT scans and the liver lesions were determined  to be cysts, she was decreased from 400mg daily to 200mg daily due to nausea on [**2152-4-5**]. -CT scan [**10/2152**] there was increase in size of a right upper mesenteric nodule with no other enlarging disease. Her case was discussed previously and surgery is an option. At this time she is interested in trying 400mg Gleevec to see if this controls/shrinks this mass.

Pt was last seen acting normally at 4:30pm, at which time she reported feeling dizzy and went to lay down. Around 7pm, she was found by her husband laying on her right side, moaning and unresponsive. No tremors or bladder or bowel incontinence noted. She was brought by EMS into the OSH ED for evaluation. There she was reportedly nonverbal but combative and received ativan 2mg IV x 2. CT head was negative for intracranial hemorrhage. CXR was significant for a RLQ pneumonia and pt was given levofloxacin 750mg IV. A digoxin level was checked which was elevated to 2.8; K was 5.7. She was given 2 vials of digibind and intubated under succinylcholine with propofol for sedation prior to transport for airway protection due to diminished gag reflex in the setting of altered mental status. ABG 7.4/41/111 on AC 500/12/70%/5.  In our ED, VS: T 97.3, HR 41, BP 154/49, O2sat 99% on AC at TV 500, rate 14, PEEP 5, and FiO2 100%. Her CXR showed a sizeable RML infiltrate, and vanco dose given with 500cc NS. EKG showed HR in low 40s. 3 vials of digibind drawn up. Toxicology was consulted and recommended holding further digibind at this time unless pt drops blood pressure as may overcompensate and affect her baseline therapeutic level of digoxin. She was transferred to MICU for monitoring.  On the MICU floor, pt report is intubated and sedated. Per her husband, she had no fevers, chills, cough, or shortness of breath suggestive of pneumonia; no choking or coughing with po intake; no recent sick contacts or hospitalizations. Pt eats small meals throughout day; husband did not note any recent change in po intake. She did not complain of any vision changes, N/V, abd pain, diarrhea, headache, confusion, or hallucinations.

Right perihilar pneumonia or hemorrhage. 2. Left retrocardiac atelectasis or aspiration. 3. Moderate cardiomegaly, without pulmonary edema.  KNEE (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) RIGHT Study Date of [**2142-7-22**] 2:46 PM The bones are diffusely demineralized. Degenerative changes are present predominantly in the medial compartment where there is joint space narrowing and subchondral sclerosis. Minimal osteophyte formation is also noted in the patellofemoral compartment. No discrete fracture is evident and there is no evidence of dislocation. An equivocal small suprapatellar joint effusion is demonstrated as well as extensive vascular calcifications within the soft tissues.  CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2142-7-24**] 1:09 AM 1. No PE. 2. Diffuse septal thickening, small bilateral pleural effusions,  cardiomegaly, and ground-glass opacities in the dependent portion of the upper and lower lobes. The constellation of findings is most compatible with CHF. 3. Subcentimeter hypodensity in the right lobe of the thyroid, for which further evaluation with ultrasound can be performed on a non-emergent basis.  TTE (Complete) Done [**2142-7-25**] at 1:51:57 PM      FINAL The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the septum and inferior walls. The remaining segments contract well (LVEF = 30-35 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta and arch are normal in diameter. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are moderately thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-2**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal. There is a no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Severe aortic valve stenosis. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.   Brief Hospital Course: 76 yo female with PMH of atrial fibrillation admitted with confusion and found to have digoxin toxicity, pneumonia and acute renal failure.  # Digoxin toxicity: Digoxin levels elevated in toxic range with bradycardia and PR prolongation.  Likely in setting of hyperkalemia from acute renal failure from dehydration, possibly secondary to pneumonia. No recent medication changes other than discontinuation of propanolol and clonidine, which do not affect the metabolization of digoxin. Patient was monitored on telemetry with frequent EKGs and labs for hyperkalemia. Her EKGs remained stable. She remained hemodynamically stable with gradually improving HRs. Toxicology was consulted and recommended holding off on digibind unless HD unstable or EKGs worsened. This did not occur and no further digibind was given. Digoxin was 1.0 on [**7-24**] and mental status resolved to baseline. Will defer to outpatient provider regarding restarting digoxin. Once bradycardia resolved patient was restarted on Metoprolol without any unstable hemodynamics.  #Hypoxemia. The patients oxygen requirements increased to using a non-rebreather mask on [**7-23**]. It is likely that this was due to CHF exacerbation (supported by BNP > [**Numeric Identifier 389**] and findings on CT) as furosemide was being held vs effusions present on CT likely secondary to the pneumonia. PE was initially considered and ruled out by CT angiogram. The patient was gradually diuresed and her respiratory status improved, though this was also likely contributed to by treatment of pneumonia.  Discharged on 2-3L/min NC with stable oxygen status to be weaned at nursing facility.  # Altered Mental Status: Likely [**3-5**] digoxin toxicity although may also have delirium in setting of infection. Was intubated at OSH for airway protection, however, after bronchoscopy here (See below) she was extubated without difficulty. CXR notable for large right middle lobe infiltrate concerning for pneumonia. Less likely neuro process; no h/o of seizures, CT head negative for acute changes. Digoxin toxicity and pneumonia were treated as described elsewhere and mental status improved to baseline.  # Pneumonia: Large RML (right middle lobe) infiltrate and leukocytosis suggestive of infectious process although patient was afebrile and asymptomatic per husband. [**Name (NI) **] likely ventilator-acquired pneumonia vs aspiration from altered mental status. Received levofloxacin and vanco prior to arrival on floor. In setting of digoxin toxicity concern for QT prolongation, she was changed to Azithromycin/Clindamycin due to a PCN allergy. After legionella antigen returned negative, azithro was discontinued. She underwent bronchoscopy and cultures which grew oropharyngeal flora. Blood cultures were negative. On [**7-21**], she spiked a fever and antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone. She again spiked on [**7-23**] and coverage broadened by changing antibiotics to cefipime and vancomycin. She should complete a 8 day course for ventilator associate pneumonia. Vancomycin is being dosed Q24 hours for renal insufficiency but will be monitored at her nursing facility should her renal function improve.  # Acute renal failure: Cr elevated above baseline here 1 year ago of 0.9. BUN/Cr ratio suggested prerenal etiology, likely in setting of pneumonia. Creatinine improved with IVF. Renally dosed meds. Held ACE-I. On [**7-23**], the patient was found to have increased oxygen requirments and was placed on a non-rebreather mask. In the setting of respiratory distress and concern for PE vs decompensated heart failure, the risks of renal insult were outweighed by the need for CT-angio with IV contrast and diuresis. Pt received N-acetylcysteine course and cautious fluid resusitation.  Upon discharge, Cr 1.3 and Lisinopril continuing to be held with possible restart at her nursing facility.  # CHF - acute on chronic, systolic: Prior TTEs not in system; EF unknown prior to admission but appeared dry here when first admitted and received gentle IVF. Held lasix in setting of dehydration. Also initially held beta blocker and ACE inhibitor as PR prolongation and ARF.  When patient developed new O2 requirment, Lasix was restarted for diuresis.  TTE obtained at that time revealed AS and EF = 30-35%.  Continued to hold ACE inhibitor for hospitalization but beta blocker was restarted and patient was continued on statin, fish oil and ASA.  # Atrial Fibrillation: Held digoxin, metoprolol and amiodarone in setting of digoxin toxicity as did not want to contribute to nodal blockade given bradycardia. INR was supratherapeutic on admission and coumadin was held. Warfarin restarted on [**7-22**] and INR has been therapeutic. Metoprolol was restarted and she remained rate controlled during the rest of her admission. Amiodarone and Digoxin were not restarted.  # Hypertension: Held metoprolol and lisinopril as above. Continued amlodipine for BP control. Restarted metoprolol, but contiue to hold lisinopril for ARF.  #Aortic stenosis: classified as severe on echocardiogram. Diuresed gently as patient was preload-dependent. Remained hemodynamically stable. Advised to manage as outpatient  # Swollen righ knee: Seen by rheumatology, whose assessment was polyarticular gout flare. The joint was aspirated and crystals were noted by Rheum fellow but not in final report. Synovial fluid with neutrophilic infiltrate. Cultures negative. Acute gout flare was treated with indomethacin and colchicine. Indomethacin was discontinued the following day given ARF.  The patinet improved and has not complained of joint pain since [**7-24**]. Colchicine discontinued on [**7-27**]. Continued home dose of Allopurinol.  # Urinary incontinence: Detrol and oxybutynin were discontinued on suspicion that they might contribute to AMS. The patient now reports feeling that she is able to adequately control her bladder, and we will defer to outpatient provider regarding these medications.  # History of TIA: No evidence of bleed on OSH CT head. Continued ASA. Therapeutic on warfarin and statin therapy.  # Hypothyroid - elevated TSH, T3 low. Patient without clinical signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism. Difficult to evaluate laboratory abnormalities in setting of acute illness and will defer treatment for now and recommend evaluation by PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] supplemental medication started.  # Thyroid hypodensity: Noted on imaging as described above. This should be followed by PCP for further evaluation and management post-discharge.  #Diabetes mellitus type 2. Managed on sliding scale insulin with basal glarigne while holding Metformin. Started home medication metformin the day of discharge as patient was 72 hours after her contrast load.  Additionally, should patient Cr worsen to > 1.5 would stop as will poorly cleared.  # Code: FULL  # Communication: With husband [**Name (NI) 401**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 23946**]) and son [**Name (NI) 4648**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 23947**])  Medications on Admission: ASA 81mg daily Allopurinol 100mg daily Amiodarone 200mg daily Amlodipine 10mg daily Atorvastatin 5mg daily Darvocet prn pain Detrol LA 2 mg daily Digoxin 125 mcg Tablet daily Diphenoxylate as needed Fish oil 1g daily Furosemide 80mg daily Lisinopril 40mg daily Metformin 500mg [**Hospital1 **] Metoprolol 100mg daily Oxybutynin 5mg [**Hospital1 **] Zaroulyn 5mg prn 30 min before lasix Warfarin 2mg qhs   Discharge Medications: 1.

Tenderness is localized to the lower abdomen and more so in the parastomal region. There is a large bulge around the ostomy. Stoma itself is fairly pink and healthy. Extremities are warm and well perfused with minimal edema.  HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for repair of her incarcerated parastomal hernia. She was taken to the Operating Room on [**2121-11-3**] for reduction, as well as colostomy re-siting into the left upper quadrant. For details of this, please see the previously dictated operative note.  Postoperatively, the patient's course was complicated by what was thought to be an aspiration event on the evening of postoperative day number two. She had acute respiratory distress, as well as change in mental status, which is different from her baseline. She was maintained with Lasix diuresis and face mask for approximately 8-12 hours but then was subsequently intubated and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for worsening respiratory status. She was initially only intubated for about 24 hours and met all criteria for extubation. Chest x-ray did confirm that she had bilateral upper zone infiltrates and the patient was empirically treated with a seven day course of vancomycin and Levaquin. After the patient met her respiratory extubation criteria, she was extubated. She continued to do fairly well but had change in mental status, which could not be attributed to anything other than alcohol withdrawal. TSH, B-12 and folate levels were checked, which were normal. CT scan of the head was obtained on [**2121-11-10**], which did not show any evidence of acute injury. There was some evidence of old lacunar infarcts. MR of the head was completed on [**2121-11-12**], which confirmed the above. In addition, the Neurology service was consulted for her change in mental status and they felt it was best attributed also to her alcohol withdrawal, as well as withdrawal from her Serax. These were restarted per their recommendations and the patient gradually improved some of her mental status.  On [**2121-11-10**], the patient was re-intubated (postoperative day number seven) for worsening respiratory status. She was maintained and ventilated during this time and had a bronchoscopy performed on [**2121-11-13**], which proved to be negative for any significant pluggings or other bronchial disease. The patient was extubated later that day on [**2121-11-13**], but then quickly failed her extubation trial within approximately six hours. She was emergently re- intubated and there was seen to be a fair amount of tracheal and laryngeal edema at that time. The decision was then made to give the patient a surgical airway and percutaneous tracheostomy was performed on [**2121-11-14**]. This was done in accordance and consent with her son, who was the healthcare proxy during her change in mental status.  Ultimately, the patient was discharged on postoperative day number fourteen to a [**Hospital 4820**] rehabilitation facility for ventilatory weaning, as well as allowing clearance of her mental status. The Neurology service had seen the patient on the day of discharge and agreed with the above and to continue present management. The patient had a post-pyloric feeding tube placed in Interventional Radiology on the day of discharge in order to decrease the risk of aspiration pneumonia. The patient was tolerating tube feeds adequate and had good function with occasional tracheostomy mask trials from the vent.  DISPOSITION:  To [**Hospital 4820**] rehabilitation facility.  DIET:  Tube feedings:  Impact with fiber (or other immunogenic tube feed formulation) at 75 cc/hr.  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Albuterol nebulizers q 6 hours p.r.n. 2. Lopressor 5 mg intravenously q 6 hours, hold for heart rate less than 60 or systolic blood pressure of less than 100. 3. Zyprexa 5 mg p.o. or per nasogastric tube daily. 4. Roxicet elixir 5-10 cc p.o. or nasogastric tube q 4 hours p.r.n. for pain. 5. Serax 15 mg p.o. or per nasogastric tube t.i.d. 6. Heparin 5,000 units subcutaneously t.i.d. 7. Dilaudid 0.5-2.0 mg intravenously or subcutaneously q 4 hours p.r.n. for pain. 8. Insulin sliding scale to cover blood sugars. This should begin at 120 and advance every 40 points of a blood sugar. The beginning scale should start at two and increase two units of insulin per 40 points of blood sugar. 9. Atrovent nebulizers inhaled q 6 hours p.r.n. 10.      Ativan 0.5-1.0 mg intravenously q 6 hours p.r.n. 11.      Prevacid 30 mg per nasogastric tube q 24 hours. 12.      Zoloft 100 mg p.o. or per nasogastric tube daily.   DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in four weeks' time. The patient should continue receiving tube feeds of an immunogenic formula at approximately 75 cc/hour. The patient should continue all of her medications as described above. In particular, it is important to continue the Serax and give Ativan p.r.n. for withdrawal symptoms. The patient should have ventilatory weaning with tracheostomy mask trials everyday until the patient can be weaned off of mechanical ventilation. The patient should have ostomy care per standard protocol.

Subacute to chronic rib fractures, including along the right posterior seventh rib, where there is faint but suspicious sclerosis extending further laterally than would usually be expected in the setting of an uncomplicated rib fracture. In the setting of prior treated hematological malignancy, the finding of vague sclerosis raises concern for a bone marrow abnormality such as myelofibrosis or potentially a form of disease recurrence. Mostly, however, the bones appear within normal limits. .

He has been known EBV+ in the past. This could also be related to sensation of dyspnea that he has been having, and warranted further cardiovascular and pulmonary work-up in parallel with the infectious work-up. In the ICU, continued broad spectrum antibiotics of vancomycin and aztreonam (given allergy).  Infectious workup largely negative including CMV VL, respiratory panel, EBV VL, fungal markers, blood cultures, urine cultures, CT chest. Pt's lethargy improved with IVFs, antibiotics, and stress dose steroids. Did not ever need pressors. . # Dyspnea/Cough: Concern for infectious process. Regarding VTE, his risk should be reduced with therapeutic INR, though the concern for coumadin failure merits consideration, though would be unlikely and he has no other signs and symptoms of DVT. PFTs completed [**9-9**], with official report pending at time of this summary. CT chest showing resolving parenchymal processes, resolving infectious/inflammatory process. Continued broad spectrum antibiotics initially. When no infiltrate noted on CXR, decreased ABX to 5 days of azithromycin for treatment of bronchitis. . # Hypotension: A bedside ""shock"" ultrasound US in ED showed no cardiac effusion, no evidence of gross RV overload. EKG unchanged. Patient's hypotension was fluid/stress dose steroids responsive. Initially given stress dose steroids with plans to resume home dose.  Also given IVF repletion. BPs normalized. Likely etiology was slight adrenal insufficiency in setting of viral syndrome despite negative infectious workup. Patient discharged with prednisone 7.5 mg daily. . # Acute Renal Failure: Likely pre-renal azotemia. Improved with IVFs. Cr 0.9 on discharge. . # Mild epigastric/RUQ tenderness: No laboratory e/o hepatitis. RUQ US showing polyp at neck of gallbladder (1.2cm), which was also seen on prior ultrasound scan [**2145-2-9**]. No other findings to explain epigastric pain. This pain has resolved on discharge. . # Pulmonary Embolism [**11-23**]: continued coumadin with INR goal [**1-19**].  # Diabetes: Continued NPH 12 units [**Hospital1 **], with close sugar monitoring and diabetic diet.

There is expected pneumobilia. In addition, there is mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, preferentially within the left system, and also involving the posterior right biliary duct which arises from the left system, an anatomic variant. The pre-contrast study demonstrates even more prominent left ductal dilation. There are equivocal areas of stenosis in the peripheral left system without evidence of central stenosis, although the evaluation of stenosis is limited by the presence of pneumobilia. In the left lobe of the liver, there is subtle hyperemia in the arterial phase without evidence of abnormality in signal on the T2-weighted images suggestive of edema. No enhancing liver lesions are identified. The gallbladder is surgically absent. Nodularity of the right adrenal gland is stable compared to the preoperative study. The left adrenal gland and spleen appear unremarkable. The pancreatic parenchyma enhances homogeneously. The pancreatic duct is not dilated. The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without hydronephrosis. There are bilateral nonenhancing renal cysts. There is mild perinephric fluid bilaterally, right greater than left. There is mild thickening of the right lateral conal fascia which is probably postoperative. Small foci of blooming artifact on the gradient-echo sequences within the mesentery near the area of surgery are likely related to hemosiderin and postoperative change. No evidence of new mass or lymphadenopathy is appreciated. The signal within the bone marrow appeared to be normal limits. The lung bases demonstrate small bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis, right greater than left. IMPRESSION: 1. Subtle hyperemia in the left lobe of the liver without evidence of edema, fluid collection, or central biliary stenosis. Equivocal stenosis in the periphery of the left biliary system is difficult to evaluate given the presence of pneumobilia. Findings could represent subclinical cholangitis, given biliary anastomoses. 2. Bilateral small pleural effusions, right greater than left, with associated atelectasis. 3. Stable nodularity in the right adrenal gland, unchanged from preoperative study.

Blood cultures drawn peripherally but not from port. The patient also report abdominal pain and has h/o abdominal abscess, but patient has had pain at baseline. CXR today showed haziness in R lower base concerning for early pna vs pulmonary edema.   UA negative making pna and UTI unlikely.  Pt has elevated liver enzymes that were normal on monday per patient. Could be elevated in setting of sepsis. No change in bowel habit, no signs of menigitis, no murmur on exam to suggest endocarditis. Tick borne disease unlikely as pt does not have any pets and does not do outdoor activities at all. No new drugs to suggest drug fever. Empiric broad spectrum antibiotics for possible line infection/intrabdominal process: linezolid, cefepime and flagyl given possible allergy to vanc and levaquin?

Neurology was consulted given the AMS, and felt it was due to a toxic-metabolic encephalopathy and not a central insult or seizure. CXR was unrevealing except for LLL atelectasis. No urine able to be obtained but blood cultures were sent. A CT head was negative. A CT abdomen and pelvis was obtained which showed no acute process or abscess, but a small hematoma/stranding in the anterior subcutaneous tissues and likely also left rectus, c/w recent surgery. Her HR did increase to the 140s in the ED, responded to IV labetolol, but pressure dropped. This responded to IVF.

Altered mental status/seizure/intubation: most likely etiology is multiple missed hemodialysis sessions/uremia. It is possible the Tylenol with codeine she was taking for post operative pain control contributed.  The morning following admission she had an episode of decreased responsiveness, clonic jerks, lip smacking and hand automatisms. She was evaluated by neurology and was given Ativan and Depakote for complex partial seizure. Approximately 1 hour after this she became unresponsive and her tongue was swollen.  She was intubated for airway protection due to angioedema. Her mental status normalized (thought to be related to post-ictal state and medications), EEG was negative for status epilepticus, head CT and toxicology screens were negative.  The patient required daily dialysis from [**Date range (3) 45315**] and her mental status normalized and was stable for several days at discharge.  2. Angioedema/respiratory failure: Her tongue was noted to be swollen prior to the administration of Depakote during suctioning prior to intubation.  The angioedema seemed to correlate with the Ativan administration. There is a report of angioedema in the past, attributed to Dilantin--but she received Ativan at that time as well.  She was treated for 24 hours with steroids with remarkable improvement.  Her lisinopril was also discontinued.  Her intubation was for airway protection in the setting of altered mental status and angioedema. She had persistent apneic episodes on the ventilator and never developed a cuff leak. She has presumed tracheal stenosis from prior tracheostomy.  She was successfully extubated in the presence of anesthesia on [**2122-9-25**].  It is recommended she have an outpatient sleep study to evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea as well as an outpatient allergy evaluation.  3. Seizures: The patient suffered a partial complex seizure on the morning after admission.  The neurology team followed the patient throughout her admission. She was initially loaded with depakote, however, this was then tapered off and her [**Date Range 13401**] dosing was increased to 500 mg twice daily and an additional dose following hemodialysis. She will follow up with Neurology as an outpatient.  4. ESRD on HD: She missed two outpatient HD sessions prior to admission.  She was dialyzed daily in the MICU from [**Date range (1) 45316**] then returned to her scheduled of T/T/Saturday.  5. Atrial fibrillation: Rate control with metoprolol. She had a single episode of RVR in the ED prior to admission which responded to labetalol, otherwise, she was effectively rate controlled.  Her INR was subtherapeutic at admission, but was therapeutic at discharge.  Her INR will need to be followed in rehabilitation and outpatient monitoring set up prior to discharge home.  6. Abdominal Pain: likely post operative, waxed and waned on this admission.  At the time of discharge, the pain was controlled by Tylenol.  Her staples were removed by the surgical team during this hospitalization.  She had increased discharge from her abdominal wound noted on [**2122-9-28**]. The surgery team evaluated and felt the wound was healing well and there was no evidence of a wound infection. They recommended daily dry dressing changes.  7. Benign Hypertension: continued on amlodipine and metoprolol. Lisinopril discontinued in the setting of angioedema and not restarted. The amlodipine was started in its place. Her blood pressure ranged 110-140s/50-70s prior to discharge.  8. Disposition: the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility.  She will benefit from a home safety evaluation and visiting nurses to evaluate medication understanding/compliance. She requires INR monitoring.  As an outpatient, she should have an allergy evaluation for the recurrent angioedema as well as a sleep study to evaluate sleep apnea.   Medications on Admission: MEDS: 1.

ANAPHYLAXIS TO BACTRIM: Patient developed fever/tachycardia/hypotension on hospital day#2; initial suspicion for sepsis syndrome, however blood cultures remained negative and hemodynamic recovery achieved with massive fluid resuscitation in the ICU - of note, patient had received dose of Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis preceding his hypotension.  A diffuse rash was transiently noted in the ICU. Upon return to the floor, he received an additional dose of Bactrim - with recurrence of fever/tachycardia/hypotension, again requiring ICU stay for massive fluid resuscitation. Although no airway compromise was noted in either case, there is certainty based on stereotyped reaction immediately following Bactrim exposure that patient experiences anaphylactic-type reaction to Bactrim, which has since been listed as a serious allergy. . 2. cellulitis/abscess - R forearm wound culture grew MSSA. Pt was initially started on vanco and linezolid in MICU to empirically cover MRSA and toxin production, changed to oxacillin and clindamycin per ID recs after sensitivy inforamation available.  Surgery drained the wound and packed with wet to dry dressings changed tid.  Erythema over R forearm decreased over stay in MICU. Pain controlled with prn morphine in MICU. - on the floor, pt's erythema around the site improved slowly. Surgery removed the wick. and started wet to dry dressings. - per ID, Use Oxacillin for MSSA coverage and Clinda, which is a protein synthesis inhibitor, for prevention of toxin production, initially.  After 5 days clinda was stopped and pt was switched over to Diclox PO and sent home with PO antibiotics. -Pt will f/u with Surgery in 1 wk of discharge. - ID will f/u on TSST toxin. . 3. ""rash"" - in MICU pt became pink throughout the body/face. ? drug reaction versus bacterial toxin.  We infused vanco slowly (over 2 hours) in case of red man syndrome. Also decided to hold Bactrim in case allergy.  The following day the pt appeared less pink and it the etiology thus remains unclear. - Once stable pt was given bactrim 1000mg SS.  Pt became hypotensive and needed to be admitted the ICU again, so this likely anaphylactic reaction. . 4. HIV/AIDS - CD4 11 as of [**6-4**], viral load 4320 as of [**6-4**]. pt not on HAART because of non-compliance. Per ID recs did NOT start on HAART in hospital but will recommend follow up as outpatient to do so.  Had started pt on Bactrim as prophylaxis but stopped after two days after pt's skin became pink all over in case of allergic rx. -Would not use Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis in this pt. Per ID may use dapsone 100 mg po Daily after G6PD results come back negative -No azithromycin for now for MAC prophylaxis as ID concerned that he may already have disseminated MAC. -f/u Mycolytic cultures in [**Hospital **] clinic and if neg can start on azithromycin - Pt. will f/u with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital **] clinic.

This has prompted consideration for admission to a psychiatric facility in order to change medications, and she was brought to the ED for medical clearance but was found to be hypothermic with a temp of 32.  At her baseline, she can feed herself and dress herself if given clothes, but she is dependent on others for all other ADLs. She occasionally mutters phrases and most of the time replies to questions with ""yes"" or ""no."" usually she has violent outbursts, and staff has been getting concerned that she seems more sluggish recently. She has had poor urine output over the past week. Has been constipated. She has had a rash for over a year that was recently biopsied by her PCP and is currently on Fluconazole. In addition, she has had insomnia, poor oral intake, and has been stumbling/falling to one side when walking. In the past, she has been sent to a psychiatric facility for changes to her medication regimen; she was sent to the ED for medical clearance.  In the ED initial vital signs were remarkable for a temperature of 32, TSH 7.7 but otherwise normal labs with lactate, negative UA, CXR and head CT after receiving a total of 20mg PO Haldol. She was placed on a Bair hugger and received 2 liters of warm NS with improvement of her temperature to 32.9. No nuchal rigidity or signs of infection. She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring and rewarming. At transfer, vitals were 32.9 (91.2), 71, 99/67, 13, 94% RA.  In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was alert, but not responding to questions or commands.  The patient was brought back to normal body temperature and then transferred to the floor.

Brief Hospital Course: 35 year-old woman with mental retardation since childhood presenting with mental status changes, ataxia, poor PO intake, and thrombocytopenia admitted with hypothermia, temperature 32C. She was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she was warmed up to euthermia and subsequently transferred to the floor. Surveillance for infections was negative.  Psychiatry was consulted to assess for possible medication related symptoms.  A swollen lower lip and swollen tongue and shortness of breath prompted an eval by ENT to r/o vocal cord edema. Workup for angioedema was initiated.  Hypothermia: The duration of her hypothermia is unclear as she previously refused vital signs for weeks. Her hypothermia could have been related to underlying mental retardation and inability to seek warmth or side effect from her antipsychotic medications.  Her core temperature increased to the lower range of normal after warming with Bair hugger and receiving 2 liters of warmed saline in the ER. SHe did not show evidence of septic physiology.  slightly elevated TSH but normal T4 indicating sick euthyroid but this is not the cause of the patients hypothermia.   Ataxia: She has had ataxia for approximately one month which could be an effect of hypothermia or related to her underlying neurologic disease.  She had a head CT that did not show any acute findings.  She continued to improve as an inpatient and was walking independently (at her baseline) on her own prior to discharge  Poor oral intake: She had poor PO intake at her group home and was seen by speech and swallow who recommended soft solids and thin liquids with meds whole or crushed in puree. Her mental status improved and she was able to take regular diet.  Poor urine output: She had poor urine output at group home, but after foley placement she had 1200cc urine output. This may be due to a medication side effect (she is on anticholinergics to prevent side effects from antipsychotics). Also has had poor oral intake recently.  After her foley was discontinued and she had ongoing urinary retention that required intermittent catheterization. Urology was consulted and recommended scheduled intermittent catheterization and Cystex tid. Patient frequently refuses catheterization, nurses have had better luck with the catheterization about 1-2 hours after antipsychotics given. All anticholinergics were stopped, including Cogentin, with some improvement in her bladder volumes. It is unclear if there is a behavioral component to her urinary retention. Her urinary retention was of moderate volume and a BUN / Cr were stable (Creatinine 0.7) on [**11-2**], she has outpt urology appt scheduled. Given the urinary retention she is at risk for urinary tract infections, the patient's group home staff was informed of signs of a UTI such as delerium / agitation / other behavioral changes or urinary changes (frequency/odor) which should prompt referral to a physician for workup of UTI.  Rash: She was seen by dermatology who confirmed with scrapings that it was fungal.  Patient has been on fluconazole for this and dermatology recommended swithcing to topical terbinafine which improved her tinea corporis significantly. She will follow up with dermatology in [**2139-12-30**].  Mental Retardation and agitation:  Her home psychiatric medications were continued including a slightly lower dose risperdal, at 5mg po bid. The psychiatric consultants felt that given the patient's behavior has returned to baseline it may be best to avoid transition to clozaril as previously discussed given the greater propensity for anticholinergic side effects and that if behavioral issues and agitation issues do arise perhaps increasing the dose of risperdal should be the first step in management rather than an alternative anti-psychotic.  Sick euthyroid: Mild TSH elevation to 7.7 with normal free T4. This should be repeated as an outpatient to screen for hypothyroidism.  Thrombocytopenia: This could be a side effect of her numerous psychiatric medications or fluconazole. This remained stable during her hospital stay and subsequently improved to normal.  Inflammation: she had an elevated ESR and CRP of unclear etiology, very non-specific. [**Doctor First Name **] was negative. Consider repeating these in [**1-31**] months after discharge.  In regards to returning to normal activity she is cleared to return to her workshop and other normal daily activities as of date of discharge, [**2139-11-3**].

Two pulmonary nodules seen in the left lower lobe, the largest measuring 2.9 x 2.2 cm. Multiple low-attenuation lesions seen within the liver, the largest of which may represent cyst, smaller lesions are not fully characterized.  Low-attenuation lesions seen within the left kidney, possibly a cyst, although too small to characterize. Per report, a CT PET performed elsewhere demonstrated uptake in the left base of the lung. - [**2131-8-14**] to [**2131-9-25**]:  Neoadjuvant chemoradiation with continuous 5-FU at 225 mg/m2/day and radiation therapy five days weekly. - [**2131-12-10**]:  Proctosigmoidectomy with stapled coloanal anastomosis and diverting loop ileostomy.  Pathology revealed adenocarcinoma of the rectum, low-grade, with invasion into the perirectal adipose tissue and metastasis to 7 of 13 regional lymph nodes (T3N2).  The resection margins were uninvolved. - [**2132-1-28**] PET Scan: Interval progression of disease with an increase in the size of the previously identified lung metastasis. There is a new FDG-avid focus in segment 4A of the liver which most likely represents metastasis. - [**2132-2-13**]: Ileostomy takedown with simultaneous flexible bronchoscopy and VATS with left lower lobe resection.  Pathology from the ileostomy stoma demonstrated no evidence of malignancy.  The left lower lobe wedge resection demonstrated an adenocarcinoma, 4.1 cm, consistent with metastasis of rectal origin.  The pleural and apparent stapled margins were free of malignancy. - [**2132-2-14**]: Evaluation by the hepatobiliary surgery consult team due to the finding on his recent PET scan of a likely liver metastasis. It was felt that the lesion was amenable to surgical resection, and it was planned that the patient would undergo two cycles of chemotherapy prior to proceeding with hepatic resection. - [**2132-4-9**]: FOLFOX chemotherapy initiated.

IMPRESSION: Unremarkable renal ultrasound without evidence of hydronephrosis.   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1683**] is a 72 yo M with h/o metastatic rectal CA and SVC syndrome, now resolved on lovenox tx, who was admitted to OMED on [**4-19**] with intractable diarrhea thought [**3-2**] chemo and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**4-24**] with BRBPR and hematemesis. GI was consulted and an EGD was performed on [**4-24**] which showed diffuse erythema/ulceration, in esophagus, stomach, duodenum. This was thought due to irinotecan induced GI toxicity.  They recommended PPI and carafate slurry.  They were concerned that patient's whole GI tract was diffusely inflamed as was seen on EGD and that the anastamotic site from his colectomy might be a bleeding source; a flex sigmoidoscopy was done on as well and showed as well diffuse ulceration and inflammation. HCTs and q6H hemodynamics remained stable throughout his hospital course. The patient was started on steroid enemas and mesalamine suppositories to decrease inflammation.  The steroid enemas were discontinued, but the mesalamine suppositories were continued through to discharge.  In total, he received 3 units PRBCs and 2 units of FFP. Stool cultures revealed no evidence of infection. . On [**4-24**], the patient was found to have that 2/2 bottles of his blood cultures drawn from his portacath were growing GPCs, speciation showed MSSA. He was treated for this with IV vancomycin, leaving the portacath and PICC in place. Daily surveillance blood cultures were performed and he was noted to clear his bacteremia on [**4-26**].  Infectious diseases was consulted and the patient was switched to nafcillin with confirmation of MSSA.  The port-a-cath was removed which was the source of infection.  The patient however despite aggressive crystalloid and colloid (albumin, a further 2 units of blood) resuscitation then developed sepsis related acute tubular necrosis.  The patient became anuric and nephrology was consulted.  Hemodialysis was initiated which the patient tolerated well, and a permanent tunneled catheter line was placed on [**2134-5-7**].  The patient was started on phosphate binders, nephrocaps and erythropoeitin dosed at hemodialysis.  The carafate was discontinued due to risk of aluminum toxicity.  The nafcillin was also changed to Cefazolin dosed 2mg at each [**Date Range 2286**] session for ease of administration and avoiding extra volume loading.  Should the patient miss [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2286**] session, extra doses of cefazolin should be administered as needed.  The patient was planned for a 28 day course of cefazolin to be finished on [**2134-5-22**]. . Other parts of his hospitalization are outlined by problem below: . #Hypotension/Tachycardia: In setting of extensive diahrrea. Ct torso is without PE or dissection. His BP initally recovered with 500cc NS bolus.  Once he had an episode of BRBPR, he became tacycardic to the 140s, with BP 90s/60s.  He was bolused NS and given PRBC with improved HR to the 110s, and BP to 120s/80s. . #SVC syndrome: occurred in [**2132**]. s/p TPA infusion followed by venous angioplasty with balloon dilation with resolution of symptoms.  He was initially treated with lovenox (dose recalculated this admission, should be lower than his admission dose), but this was held secondary to GI bleed.  This was not restarted at discharge given the patient's renal failure. . #Diarrhea - the patient continued to have diarrhea that was controlled with titration of his anti-diarrheal medications. Infectious sources were ruled out and the cause was likely irinotecan-induced GI toxicity and radiation proctitis.  #Generalized anasarca - The patient was noted to have an extremely low albumin on admission, likely related to poor nutrition due to his GI pathology.  Albumins ranged between 2.7 and 1.9.  During volume resuscitation the patient became grossly edematous, and albumin was administered to little effect.  His left upper extremity was noted to be more edematous than the rest of his body, and a LUE ultrasound was acquired.  This demonstrated no evidence of clot.  The patient slowly became less edematous when [**Year (4 digits) 2286**] was initiated and ultrafiltration was started.

We believe the diarrhea was a side effect of the chemotherapy you had received; it was treated with 3 anti-diarrheal medications. You also have a low blood pressure on admission, this was likely due to dehydration in the setting of diarrhea, and it improved with rehydration with IV fluids. Your diarrhea then became bloody, and you also had an episode of vomit with blood in it. As a result, you were transferred to the ICU.  You had an upper endoscopy and a sigmoidoscopy, which showed ulceration in your esophagus, stomach and colon.  This was thought to be due to the chemotherapy and radiation that you have been receiving for your colon cancer. . While admitted, you also had a severe bacterial infection that got into your blood.  This severely damaged your kidneys, requiring you to be started on hemodialysis.  You had a permanent [**Location (un) 2286**] catheter placed and you will need to continue getting [**Location (un) 2286**] 3 times a week.  You were started on several new medications when you were admitted.

Facial swelling: possibly angioedema given recent initiation of ACEi but also possibly related to the fall and trauma.  At this point will avoid ACEi or [**Last Name (un) **] and have placed lisinopril on his allergy list.  SYNCOPE / AUTNOMIC DYSFUNCTION: symptoms of presyncope chronically (for 2 years) and a formal diagnosis of autnomic dysfunction has been made with tilt table testing here at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2190**].  He had previously been on midodrine and florinef but was hypertensive so these were discontinued.  He has most recently been on flomax and lisinopril and was more orthostatic. For now I have changed his regimen to norvasc 2.5mg po daily and thigh high TEDS stockings.  In addition given his CT C spine findings and his recurrent falls I feel that it would be dangerous for him to ambulate without an assist device.  I have recommended a walker with a seat so that he can sit down immediately should he feel lightheaded, I have strongly urged he use this at all times given his high risk to fall, and have suggested if this is ineffective he may at somepoint be committed to a wheelchair given his severe autnomic dysfunction. In addition he will have a home safety evaluation by VNA.  He had no acute fractures as a result of his fall.  I have also checked a B12 which was 400 and an RPR which was non reactive given that he had a + romberg sign suggestive of posterior column spinal cord disease.

Past Medical History: Past Medical History: Breast cancer - Diagnosed in [**2174**] with an infiltrating lobular carcinoma grade  II, 1.7 cm, multifocal, with 13 out of 29 lymph nodes positive. The tumor was ER positive, PR positive, and HER-2/neu negative by both IHC and FISH. She underwent adjuvant chemotherapy after completion of surgery with Adriamycin and Cytoxan followed by 10  weekly doses of Taxol. She received and completed chest wall radiation. She was then started on adjuvant Arimidex therapy. In  [**2178-1-25**] she developed right shoulder pain and pain in her upper abdomen. The abdominal pain prompted workup and apparently  blood work showed a CA [**95**]-29 level of 203. A PET scan revealed nodularity in her omentum consistent with metastatic disease. A bone scan reportedly was negative. She was started on high-dose Faslodex hormone treatment [**2178-3-12**] and progressed on this  in [**2178-7-25**].

Was tachycardic and complaining of mild chest tightness.  Admitted to the ICU for tachycardia and hyponatremia, then to the oncology floor.  See below for discussion of each issue. . Goals of care: meeting in ICU regarding goals of care and poor prognosis, then reiterated on the oncology medicine floor: Code: DNR/I (discussed with patient and HCP), and daughter HCP [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 80568**]. Focus on comfort with symptom management. Avoidance of invasive procedures, per family (son, daughter, sister). [**Name2 (NI) **] died the morning after being transferred to the ICU. . # Altered mental status: Patient does not respond to verbal or visual stimuli on the floor. Likely d/t progressive metastatic disease, combined with renal failure, hypotension, pain, SBP infection, delirium. Pain controlled with IV morphine prn, treated SBP with ceftriaxone, palliative care following. . # Chest Pain: unclear etiology, seemed to be costrochondritis related as the pain was reproducible. Ruled out for MI with three sets of negative cardiac enzymes.  A V/Q of her chest was ordered to rule out PE, but the patient was unable to lie flat and complete the exam so it was aborted. Held anticoagulation d/t goals of care, no CTA given ARF, could not tolerate V/Q scan. On the floor, patient unable to verbalize whether chest pain still present. Pain medications provided. . # Hypotenion/Tachycardia: likely was related to underlying cancer and hypovolemia.  Was volume resuccitated with NS and the LR while in the ICU for the first two days.  She was offerred a CVL in the ED and declined.  Her BP improved to SBPs in the 90s, then 100s with IVFs and remained stable.  Initially she seemed fluid responsive with a decrease in rate from 130s to 110s (which seemed to be her baseline).  She remained tachycardic on day two of admission without an obvious cause as she seemed mostly fluid repleted.  We continued to bolus her and pursued a further workup for PE.  Initially she had negative LENIs and a CT was deferred because of ARF.  A V/Q scan was performed on [**2179-3-10**], but she was unable to lie flat for the test and the test could not be completed.  She was bolused periodically overnight to maintain MAP of over 65.  Her tachycardia improved with IVF boluses prn. . # Hyponatremia/Acute renal failure: Based on exam and history, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia. Most likely Gi losses combined with third spacing in the setting of ascites. With fluid resuccitation, she corrected and normalized very quickly but did not have any neurological changes.  She did have a CT head in the ED that showed no intracranial lesions to explain this.  Her ARF also improved with IVFs and her urine output remained brisk throughout her hospitalization. . # Thrush: Likely due to poor po intake and nausea/vomitting. Started swish and swallow for her comfort. . # Breast Cancer: mid-cycle in her avastin and navelbine.  Is metastatic and has recurrent ascites requiring taps.  On presentation, her abdomen was soft and a therapeutic paracentesis was deferred because of her hypovolemia, moderate hypotension and neutropenia.  Oncology was consulted and followed along.  Patient to oncology floor, outpatient oncology attending described poor prognosis. Family meeting regarding poor prognosis and goals of care; patient not to have further chemotherapy or interventions/invasive procedures. . # Leukopenia: Likely chemo related, as last dose was [**3-1**]. ANC 600 so not yet neutropenic and never needed to be on neutropenic precautions. On 3 18, her WBC began to recover. . # Pleurex catheter placed to help with paracentesis/ascites drainage.

She underwent CT scan of her chest for re-staging of her lung cancer on [**2159-8-6**], which demonstrated an increasingly large pericardial effusion (had been previously noted on PET scan in [**Month (only) 116**]). She has recently been experiencing worsening shortness of breath at home, which she notices only with exertion such as carrying a full basket of laundry. She has had some associated cough, but no sputum production. In addition, about 3 weeks ago she was seen at [**Hospital3 1443**] hospital for chest pain; she was ruled out for MI and planned for outpatient echocardiogram, which would have been today but she cancelled given her oncology appointments. She has not had a recurrence of the chest pain. She was seen today in clinic today by her oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who noted her complaints of worsening dyspnea on exertion and referred her to the ED for echocardiogram to evaluate for possible tamponade. In the ED, echocardiogram showed brief right atrial collapse and impaired filling of the right ventricle consistent with early tamponade physiology.  She was evaluated by interventional cardiology and taken to the catheterization lab for pericardial fluid removal. . She underwent pericardial drain placement with ~400 cc of bloody fluid removed, followed by rapid drainage of another ~150cc into the drainage bag. She tolerated the procedure well. Immediate post-procedure echo showed small residual pericardial effusion with no Fluid was sent for cytology. Her oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] and updated with the events of the procedure. He requested transfusion of 2 units pRBCs for anemia. . On the floor, she reports feeling well. No current SOB at rest or chest pain (only very mild site tenderness with drain placement). . Of note, her cancer history is well-documented in OMR note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] dated [**2159-8-9**]. Briefly, she initially presented in [**Month (only) 404**] with hematuria, and further work up revealed both a large 9-cm renal mass and a RUL 9-cm mass with mediastinal nodes. Based on renal biopsy (RCC, clear cell type) and bronchial brushings (likely adenocarcinoma) these are two separate cancers.  She has been treated with chemotherapy with cysplatin and paclitaxel (start date [**2159-7-12**]) and radiation therapy to the chest, in addition to unilateral nephrectomy in 4/[**2159**]. . On review of systems, she endorses bilateral chronic hip pain with walking (not new or changed), and dark stool secondary to iron use. She denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery (though had one GI bleed on aspirin in [**2154**]), myalgias, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills, nightsweats or rigors. No recent cold or flu symptoms. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. She denies dysuria or other urinary symptoms. Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea (sleeps with one flat pillow), ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  All of the other review of systems were negative.

Admitted to CCU for monitoring s/p pericardial drain placement.  ACTIVE ISSUES: . # PERICARDIAL EFFUSION: Pericardiocentesis was performed with immediate drainage of 400cc sanguinous fluid. Overnight, another ~450cc sanguinous fluid drained, and samples were sent for gram stain, protein content, culture, electroyltes and cytology. Post-procedure echo showed a small loculated residual effusion with no evidence of tamponade physiology. Cytology was negative for malignacy, but suspicion remains high for a malignant etiology. Pulsus was followed throughout her hospital course, and at the time of post-procedure echo pulses was 12 by doppler. Pt was asymptomatic at the time of discahrge and specifically denied CP/SOB/DOE, palpitations or lightheadedness. If pericardial effusion reaccumulates, would consider CT surgery consult for pericardial window. . # RENAL CELL CARCINOMA, NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER: No treatments were undertaken during this hosptial course. Pt was discahrged with Heme/Onc follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. . # TACHYCARDIA - Pt remained tachycardic to the 100-120s throughout her course. Initially it was felt this may have been [**2-28**] tamponade physiology, but tachycardia persisted s/p pericardiocentesis. She was then transfused 2U pRBCs at the request of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and bolused 1L NS due to concern for anemia/hypovolemia, but tachycardia persisted. Review of clinic visits revealed that she has been persistently  tachycardic for several months, which may be related to the small loculated effusion that was not accessed by the tap. The patient denied pain throughout her course and refused any pain medicaitons. Orthostatics were checked at discahrge and were normal. . # ANEMIA: Her Hct has trended down over the past 6 months. This is likely related to chonric disease, and pt was transfused 2U pRBCs during this admission. She is taking Fe supplementation, which was continued during her hospitalization. . # LEUKOCYTOSIS: She had a low grade leukocytosis throughout her admission, which is consistent with her baseline. Suspect this is related to her malignancies. She remained afebrile and normotensive throughout her course, pericardial and urine cultures were negative and CXR showed no evidence of pulmonary process. . CHRONIC ISSUES: . # HYPERTENSION: Generally normotensive. Continued home meds (amlodipine 10 mg PO daily, HCTZ 25 mg PO daily) with holding parameters. . # HYPERLIPIDEMIA: Continued rosuvastatin 10 mg PO QHS. . # DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: Denies current depression. States she takes Xanax once daily in the mornings. Continued Effexor XR 150 mg PO daily. Continued Xanax 0.5 mg PO daily (in AM). . # OSTEOPOROSIS: Continued alendronate 70 mg PO Q week (Mondays). . TRANSITION OF CARE: Pt was discharged home with Heme/Onc follow up. She was also scheduled for an outpatient echo that should be followed up by her PCP/Oncologist. She was instructed to return to the ER if she experiecned worsening SOB/CP, as this may represet reaccumulation of pericardial fluid.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms [**Known lastname 90050**],  It was a pleasure caring for you at the [**Hospital1 827**]. You were admitted for a condition called pericardial tamponade. This is caused by fluid surrounding the heart, and it can cause the heart to not beat effectively. For this you underwent pericardiocentesis, a procedure where a doctor drains the fluid with a needle to restore the normal functioning of the heart. After this procedure we performed another Echocardiogram to confirm that the fluid had not reaccumulated and felt you were safe to return home.  During this hospitalization, we made NO CHANGES to your medicatios.  It will be important for you to follow up the results of the cytology from your pericardial fluid analysis with you oncologist.

Per report, the patient had a fall 2 days ago after slipping on ice after the snowstorm and falling on her right side. She was diagnosed with R sided rib fractures during an urgent care visit at the [**Hospital 6598**] [**Hospital **] Clinic the next day. She was prescribed vicodin and asked to come back for CT scan. Family states the patient took [**1-20**] a tablet of vicodin last night, but did not become altered until this morning. When they came to see her at home, they found she was more altered; she was lying on the couch, more lethargic, not taking good POs or any of her medications, and complaining of a headache. She was brought into the OSH ([**Hospital1 **]/[**Hospital1 6136**]) for further evaluation. There, the patient was given Narcan without good effect. She was reportedly intubated for a GCS of 6 and for airway protection in the setting of vomiting.

Altered mental status: Patient was initially found to have altered mental status after slip and fall on ice. She sustained R sided rib fractures which were treated with vicodin. She was found by family to be altered and brought to OSH where she was intubated for GCS 6. She had also had a URI prior to OSH presentation. Initial AMS was likely multifactorial due to infection (pneumonia, likely acquired in setting of splinting from rib pain [**2-20**] fractures), medication induced from narcotics (received vicodin for pain control) but urine toxicology screen also positive for methadone, and ABG showed an acute respiratory acidosis concerning for respiratory depression. Toxicology screen negative at OSH for EtOH, APAP, and ASA. No evidence of new ICH or stroke on head CT. No evidence of UTI on urine analysis. Cardiac etiology was ruled out with cardiac enzymes negative x 2. Patient was extubated with good mental status but subsequently became increasingly altered, thought to be associated with morphine use for pain control. This delirium resolved upon avoiding opioid medications such as morphine and oxycodone. . # Respiratory Failure: Pt initially hypoxic with pna and splinting from pain, intubated [**2-20**] altered mental status. The pt was extubated after transfer from [**Hospital1 18**], with decreasing O2 requirement. She was found to have a pneumonia and was started on Levaquin for presumed CAP. However, patient continued spiking despite abx. Given sputum cx stained 2+ GPC in pairs and chains, 2+ [**Name (NI) **], pt was broadened to Vanc/Zosyn (pt is allergic to penicillins but has tolerated zosyn in the past). Abx were continued for an eight day course (last day [**2-9**]). She was also encouraged to use incentive spirometer and pain was controlled as below. . # [**Last Name (un) **], prerenal, hypovolemic: pt??????s cr increased from nadir 1.0 to 1.5. Cr improved with ivf hydration.  Cr was 1.2 by next day. . # normocytic anemia: Hct down to 32.9 from 42 at OSH. HCT slowly trending down. No evidence of intra-abdominal bleed on CT scans. Iron studies [**Location (un) 381**] levels, showing element of iron deficiency, likely mixed with anemia of chronic disease.  no colonoscopy in system.   B12 and folate nl. . #. Rib fractures: s/p fall with R sided rib fractures from T3-T7. Pain control with standing tylenol, lidocaine patch x3 for rib fractures, oxycodone prn pain. Patient initially treated with morphine however it was felt to contribute to here AMS. Patient's pain controlled with around the clock Tylenol and lidocaine patches. . # Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy: CT scan showed areas of mediastinal lymphadenopathy thought to be less consistent with reactive process.  Could be sarcoid vs. malignancy.  Should be followed up with an outpatient biopsy to assess for malignancy. Patient scheduled for Interventional Pulmonology clinic on [**2-18**] at noon.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 88248**],  You were transferred to our hospital to care for a pneumonia that was the result of a probable aspiration event during a state of altered mental status.  We believe the pain medications in the opioid class (including morphine, vicodin, codeine) worsen your mental status and make you delirious.  Please AVOID TAKING THESE MEDICATIONS.  We treated your probable pneumonia with antibiotics, that should be completed on [**2154-2-9**].  We placed a special i.v. into your arm that can be used for these medications.  Also of note, a CAT scan at the beginning of your visit here showed a left lower lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia. However, it also showed a couple abnormalities that will require followup.  This includes: 1) Mediastinal lymphadenopathy - size is less compatible with reactive nodes, and may be compatible with metastatic nodes or sarcoidosis. 2) Left adrenal nodule, incompletely characterized - a dedicated adrenal CT  Please follow up with our pulmonologists and your primary doctor to set up these examinations to further evaluate these findings.  We controlled your pain from your rib fractures with Tylenol and lidocaine patches, since other medications worsened your mental state.  Please continue to take these as needed for your pain.  Followup Instructions: Please follow up with your primary care physician as soon as you can after discharge  Please also follow up with our pulmonary clinic to follow up on the abnormal CAT scan findings. You have an appointment with the interventional pulmonology clinic here at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Ward Name **] at 12 PM on [**2154-2-18**].

Stable bilateral encephalomalacia. . CT Neck [**2112-11-10**] 1. No fracture or subluxation. 2. Apparent degenerative changes at C5-6 with probable endplate Schmorl's nodes which appear similar, although somewhat progressed since the prior MR study. Posterior disc osteophyte complex at C5-6 and disc bulge at C6-7 slightly indent the thecal sac. Anterior disc space widening at C6-7 is chronic. 3. Right thyroid enlargement which slightly indents the trachea.  . CXR [**2112-11-10**]: FINDINGS: AP and lateral upright radiographs of the chest were obtained. There are moderately low lung volumes. The previously seen right lower lung opacity has improved, but not completely resolved and may reflect residual atelectasis or infection. The previously described right paratracheal fullness is stable and is attributable to tortuous vessels as seen on prior CT studies. Trachea is stably narrowed at the level of the thoracic inlet and is attributable to tortuous vessels as noted on CT torso. There is stable cardiomegaly. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  IMPRESSION: Improvement in right lower lung opacity which has not completely resolved and may reflect residual atelectasis or infection. . CXR line placement [**2112-11-10**]: FINDINGS: There is a newly placed left internal jugular catheter with the tip positioned in the upper SVC. No pneumothorax is present. Bibasilar atelectasis is present. The cardiac silhouette, hilar, and mediastinal contours appear stable. . IMPRESSION: Satisfactory central line position without pneumothorax. Bibasilar atelectasis. . CT-torso ([**2112-11-22**]): IMPRESSION: 1. Unchanged right perinephric and retroperitoneal hematoma. 2. Small right pleural effusion with consolidated portions of the right middle and lower lobes containing hyperdense material suggesting aspiration as a possible etiology. . CT-head ([**2112-11-24**]): FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. Again noted are large, bilateral ares of encephalomalacia in the MCA territory is present since [**2107**], likely due to old infarcts. A small right cerebellar hypodensity is again noted. The ventricles and sulci are enlarged, likely due to a combination of age-related atrophy and prior infarctions. No fractures are identified.  Line placements by IR ([**2112-12-15**]): IMPRESSION: 1. Successful placement of a 4 French single-lumen PICC via the left basilica vein approach, terminating at the cavoatrial junction. The line is ready for use. 2. Successful conversion of a temporary catheter for a tunneled 15.5 French dual-lumen hemodialysis catheter via the left IJ approach, with the tip terminating within the right atrium. The line is ready for use. 3. Left arm venogram demonstrating marked tortuosity at the basillic-axillary junction and a diminutive cephalic vein. All visualized veins are patent   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 year-old man with a PMH notable for ESRD on HD (MWF), chronic aspiration, seizure disorder, history of CVA with residual left-sided weakness and dysarthria, who presented to the ED s/p seizure and hypoglycemia. Course was complicated by RP bleed, s/p IR embolization of R renal artery [**2112-11-17**], PNA s/p course of Vanc/Zosyn/Tobra, and inability to clear his own secretions with subsequent recurrent mucus plugging and chronic aspiration, leading to episodes of hypoxic respiratory distress. . # Seizures: The patient had a witnessed event in which he had whole-body shaking and was non-responsive. DDx for seizure precipitant includes metabolic etiology such as [**2-24**] hypoglycemia vs. infection vs. medication non-compliance. Not likely acute intracranial process as no changed on CT head w/o. No reason to believe that the patient has been missing his medications, per family and daycare. He has no complaints, and no s/s of infection (no fever, symptoms, and CXR w/no focal infiltrate), which could also precipitate seizures. Per reviewing [**Name (NI) **], pt has been admitted frequently for these seizures every few months. The ED [**Name (NI) 653**] pt's outpt Neurologist who recommended increasing Keppra dose to 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] and continuing 500mg after HD and checking a level.  Keppra level was obtained but pending as it is a send out. Oxcarbazepine 150mg [**Hospital1 **] continued. Treatment of hypoglycemia as below. . # Hypoglycemia: Pt presented with significant hypoglycemia of unknown etiology. There is no evidence of iatrogenic cause of hypoglycemia.  Workup included fasting C-peptide and insulin level, which were non-diagnostic given the venous glucose for the specimen was not less than 50.  There was no evidence of adrenal insufficiency.  His hypoglycemia resolved after RP bleed for unclear reasons. . # Aspiration: Pt has a documented history of chronic aspiration likely secondary to his CVA, and has been evaluated by speech and swallow multiple times in the past.  Pt was found to be at increased risk for aspiration.  However, family in the past had insisted on continued feeding, regardless of aspiration risk. In [**Month (only) **], speech and swallow commented that ""As aspiration risks are similar across consistencies, pt comfort should be deciding factor in diet order"".  Pt was placed on mechanical soft diet/dysphagia diet on admission, as quality of life was considered to be the number one priority by the family.  During this admission, pt was found to have significant worsening aspiration, manifested by copious secretions in airway.  He had multiple episodes of desatting both in the MICU and on the regular floor.  He collapsed his right lung several times in the setting of mucus plugging.  For all these episodes, he responded well with suction and chest PT.  After lengthy discussion with family, decision was made to feed the patient despite the aspiration risk. A PEG tube was deferred given successful eating without obvious aspiration. . # Fistula thrombosis/Access: Following his stay in the ICU the patient had a thrombosed fistula.  The level of thrombosis was too much for vascular or for IR to open the fistula.  He had a temporary line placed that was converted to a tunneled catheter for dialysis and IR was able to place a PICC for further access via venogram.  He will be discharged on a heparin drip-to-warfarin bridge for this thrombosis and a catheter-associated thrombus in the right IJ. . # Line infection: The patient had pus noted around his right IJ following his time in the ICU.  Cultures subsequently grew resistant Klebsiella and coagulase negative gram positive cocci, along with confirmation from 1 subsequent blood culture.  He will be treated for a total of two weeks with vancomycin and cefepime, to be completed on [**2112-12-20**].  # Retroperitoneal bleed with subsequent anemia: Pt was found to have tachycardia and hypotension on HD#7, with a 9-point HCT drop.  He underwent CTA, and was found to have multifocal retroperitoneal bleed in the right kidney.  He was admitted to MICU and intubated for airway protection.  Pt had a total of 9 units pRBC.  Transcatheter embolization of the right kidney was performed and hemodynamic stability was achieved.  Subsequently, his hematocrit continued to run low, requiring intermittent transfusions of RBCs at dialysis, with a nadir of 19.9. Nephrology will be assessing whether he should be started on Epogen at dialysis. . # Pneumonia: Pt was found to have pneumonia on MICU day 4, with leukocytosis and fever.  The etiology of pneumonia was HCAP vs VAP.  He was treated with vanco, zosyn and tobra for a total of 9 days.  His WBC and fever resolved s/p antibiotics treatment. . CHRONIC ISSUES: # ESRD on HD: MWF, received dialysis on schedule.  Access is now a tunneled line, given AVG thrombosis and he should be continued on sevelamer and nephrocaps. . # Pancytopenia: Pt with macroycytic anemia and thrombocytopenia prior. However, WBC mildly decreased at presentation to 3.0, which is a change from prior. No s/s infection, CXR without focal infiltrate as above.  B12 and folate were high. . # CAD/CVA history: ECG unchanged from prior. We initially continued home aspirin, statin, metoprolol, and coumadin, but the RP bleed complicated this regimen.  Once embolization was done and hematocrit was deemed stable, multiple thromboses were discovered in right IJ and RUE AVG.  Therefore, a heparin drip was started and he was bridged to coumadin. . # Depression: on fluoxetine as listed discharge med but held on discharge as it causes hypoglycemia and it can lower the seizure threshold. .

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: primary diagnosis: hypoglycemia, seizure disorder, end stage renal disease secondary diagnosis: hypertension, coronary artery disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: [**Hospital1 **] and interactive. Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.   Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **], You were admitted for seizure, which was likely in the setting of hypoglycemia. You have often become hypoglycemic in the past and it is unclear why this keeps happening. You were evaluated for this but the results of the studies can be discussed in outpatient follow up. Because you continue to be hypoglycemic, it was felt that you might be best served by placement in a long term care facility.   While in the hospital, you received hemodialysis per your normal schedule.  You will continue to get hemodialysis as an outpatient while you are in the long term care facility.  Please note the following changes to your medications: STOP aspirin, since you will be on coumadin STOP fluoxetine, as it can contribute to hypoglycemia START coumadin, with dosing to be adjusted per your MDs START heparin IV, dosing to be adjusted per your MDs START cefepime and vancomycin to help fight bacteria in your blood  Please be sure to follow up with your physicians as below.  Followup Instructions: You will be seen by the doctors at the [**Name5 (PTitle) **]-term care facility. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], your primary care doctor, will see you if you are discharged from this facility.  Please feel free to call him with any questions - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**].  You should see your outpatient neurologist to continue managing your anti-seizure medications.  Appointment information is below:  Department: NEUROLOGY When: [**Telephone/Fax (1) **] [**2113-1-6**] at 2:00 PM With: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7025**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3294**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) 858**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage  You will continue getting dialysis at your regular location.

Renal was consulted and felt her renal failure was likely attributable to evolving ATN in the setting of poor forward flow related to her recent MI and possibly due to contrast nephropathy given a recent catheterization. The patient became oliguric and subsequently volume overloaded and hypoxic. Aggressive diuresis with IV lasix and diuril were unsuccessful so CVVH was initiated. At this point she had become hemodynamically unstable requiring pressor support with dopamine. Hemodynamic instability was likely also affected by patient's development of slow atrial fibrillation which requried placement of a trancutaneous pacer. Her dopamine requirement increased significantly with CVVH which likely contributed to the development of metabolic acidosis. On [**8-4**] the patient was found to have a lactate of 11 and had developed agonal respirations. She underwent intubation which did not help to improve her worsening acidemia. The patient's family decided to change her code status to DNR/DNI and soon after to CMO when it was clear that her prognosis had become very poor. She was pronounced dead on [**2181-8-5**] at 0313. Her three daughters were at her bedside and agreed in declining an autopsy.

Her course was complicated by acute renal failure, acute heart failure which ultimately led to pressor support. Patient developed metabolic acidosis and subsequent respiratory failure requiring intubation. Her family ultimately decidied to make her DNR/DNI and soon after CMO given her critical condition and poor prognosis. She died on [**2181-8-5**] at 0313 with her family at her bedside.

The patient had a urinary tract infection with probable urosepsis and he is chronically treated with Foley catheter as a result of his atonic bladder which was thought to be related to his systemic amyloidosis which he has been diagnosed with for some time.  The patient developed urosepsis, took out his Foley catheter with the balloon inflated and was taken to an outside hospital for reinsertion of the Foley catheter and evaluation of hematuria.  The patient had significant pain with reinsertion of the Foley catheter and was resisting significantly in the Emergency Room and was given multiple pain medications, most notably Versed for sedation and pain control in order to place the Foley catheter.  Unfortunately the patient became apneic and went into respiratory failure and was intubated.  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 256**] intubated and directly transferred to the Fenard Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was monitored for one night in the Intensive Care Unit on mechanical ventilation.  He was doing fine and had no signs of pulmonary function outside of a possible pneumonia in the left lower lobe.  The patient took out his own endotracheal tube on the second day of admission and did very well with no further evidence of respiratory failure over-sedation from the Versed that he received the day prior.  The patient was then transferred to the [**Company 191**] Medicine Service on [**11-29**].  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Cardiac amyloidosis echocardiogram from [**2119-11-22**] showing diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with ejection fraction of 40%, diffusely hypokinetic right ventricle, amyloidosis on a lung basis. Left lower lobectomy, status post limited stage lung cancer. Cervical and spinal lumbar stenosis, status post multiple back surgeries and complicated by atonic bladder, peripheral neuropathy, bilateral ulnar neuropathy, status post carpal tunnel surgery on the right, depression with question of bipolar disorder and recurrent urinary tract infections secondary to chronic Foley catheterization.  HOSPITAL COURSE:  Shortness of breath - The patient continued to improve from a respiratory standpoint and required no oxygen.  After being extubated there were no signs of congestive heart failure and was maintained on 1.5 liter fluid restriction q. day and his outpatient Lasix regimen.  Urinary tract infection - Foley catheterization, the patient tolerated his Foley catheter and was treated with Levaquin for urinary tract infection and possible left lower lobe pneumonia, all of this was felt to be atelectasis upon further review of the chest radiographs.  The patient was to complete a seven day course of Levaquin, 500 mg q. day.  He had no urinary symptoms on discharge.  DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to [**Location (un) 2716**] Point.

There was a large palpable mass in both the upper and lower abdomen.  There was no evidence of ascites.  Extremities were without edema.  On bimanual examination vulva and vagina were normal.  The cervix was normal.  Bimanual rectovaginal examination revealed a large pelvic mass, which was somewhat ill-defined. There was no cul-de-sac nodularity and the rectum was intrinsically normal.  It was explained to the patient that this mass could be benign or malignant and it was recommended to undergo surgical excision including exploratory laparotomy, TAH/BSO and resection of the mass.  The risks and benefits were discussed.  Surgical consent was signed.  HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent an examination under anesthesia, exploratory laparotomy, TAH/BSO and resection of a pelvic mass on [**2171-3-26**].  Intraoperative findings include an enlarged uterus with a subserosal fibroid and evidence of tumor extending to the right lateral rectoperitoneum as well as centrally and left into the sigmoid and small bowel mesentery up to the splenic flexure of the colon.  The anatomic survey was otherwise unremarkable.  There was subcentimeter periaortic lymph nodes and normal ovaries bilaterally with 2 liters of bloody ascites in the abdomen.

The patient's hematocrit was 27.2, INR 1.2, PTT 28.3, electrolytes were within normal limits.  The patient at this time had been transferred to the unit for further monitoring.  She had been given 7 units of packed red blood cells.  She was in stable condition. Postoperative day one the patient's vital signs continued to be stable with adequate urine output overnight.  Her examination was appropriate postoperatively.  On postoperative day one hemodynamically yesterday's hematocrit was 27, which improved to 34 after 2 more units of packed red blood cells.  There is no evidence of ongoing intraabdominal bleeding.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition: the patient had adequate urine output with no evidence of fluid overload.  Pain, the patient was on a Dilaudid PCA.  On postoperative day two the patient was extubated.  Her pain was controlled. She was tolerating clears.  No nausea or vomiting.  No chest pain or shortness of breath.  She was afebrile.  Her vital signs were stable.  She had adequate urine output.  Her most recent hematocrit was 34.5.  Her electrolytes were within normal limits.  Her abdomen was appropriately tender and nondistended.  Renal: her urine output was normal.  Her Foley catheter was discontinued.  Her creatinine was 0.6.  The patient was encouraged to ambulate.  Her diet was advanced.  Hematology: patient had 9 units of packed red blood cells, 4 units of fresh frozen platelets.  Her blood pressure was stable.  Her hematocrit was 34.5.  Coumadinization was started on postoperative day two.  Pulmonary, the patient's supplemental oxygen was weaned for oxygenation of greater then 93%.  On postoperative day three the patient was without complaints. She was tolerating clears.
